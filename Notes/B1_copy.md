<p>Title: "China's Electric Cars: A Threat to Western Brands?"</p>
<p>China's electric cars are becoming more popular and affordable, but some people are worried about the impact on Western brands. The BYD Dolphin Surf, a small electric car, has been very successful in China and is now being sold in Europe. It is expected to be priced around £18,000 in the UK, making it one of the cheapest electric cars available.</p>
<p>BYD, the company behind the Dolphin Surf, is already the biggest player in China's electric car market and has overtaken Tesla as the world's best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer. The company wants to be number one in the British market within 10 years.</p>
<p>Other Chinese brands, such as Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, are also expanding into Europe and could become household names. They offer a wide range of electric cars, from small runabouts to exotic supercars.</p>
<p>However, some experts are concerned that Chinese electric cars could pose a security risk due to hacking and third-party interference. Additionally, Western manufacturers are worried about the competition from Chinese brands, which have lower labor costs and government subsidies.</p>
<p>The US government has raised import tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars to 100%, effectively blocking them from the US market. The European Commission has also expressed concerns about the impact of Chinese state subsidies on the European market.</p>
<p>Overall, China's electric cars are changing the global automotive industry, and Western brands will need to adapt to stay competitive.</p>

<p>Title: "Chinese Student's Harvard Speech Sparks Controversy"</p>
<p>A 25-year-old Chinese student named Jiang Yufeng gave a speech at Harvard University's graduation ceremony. She talked about the importance of kindness and humanity in a world that is becoming more divided. However, her speech sparked controversy in both the US and China.</p>
<p>In the US, some people thought that Jiang's speech was a message from Harvard to the Trump government. In China, some people criticized Jiang's speech, saying it was full of Western values and empty words. They also questioned her family background, suggesting that she only got into Harvard because of her father's connections.</p>
<p>Jiang tried to explain herself on social media, but it only made things worse. She said she felt like she was being "drowned" by the criticism and that she had "felt the reality" of the situation. Despite this, Jiang still believes in the importance of kindness and humanity.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding Jiang's speech has highlighted the difficulties faced by Chinese students in the US, particularly those from wealthy or well-connected families. It has also shown how sensitive and divided the current social and political climate is.</p>
<p>Jiang's story is similar to that of another Chinese student, Yang Shuping, who gave a graduation speech at the University of Maryland in 2017. Yang's speech also sparked controversy, and she was criticized for her comments about air pollution in China.</p>
<p>Overall, Jiang's speech at Harvard has sparked a lot of debate and discussion about the role of Chinese students in the US, the importance of kindness and humanity, and the challenges of navigating complex social and political issues.</p>

<p>Title: "Using 'Poo Pills' to Fight Superbugs"</p>
<p>Doctors in the UK are trying a new way to fight superbugs, which are bacteria that are hard to kill with antibiotics. They are using "poo pills" that contain good bacteria from healthy people's stool. The idea is to replace the bad bacteria in the body with good ones. The pills are made from stool samples that are frozen and then put into a special capsule. When the capsule reaches the intestines, it dissolves and releases the good bacteria.</p>
<p>So far, the results are promising. The good bacteria have been found in the patients' intestines for at least a month after taking the pills. The doctors think that this treatment could help fight superbugs and make people healthier. They also believe that it could be used to prevent infections in people who are at risk, such as those with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>This is a new approach to fighting superbugs, and it's based on the idea that the bacteria in our bodies are important for our health. The researchers are excited about the potential of this treatment and think that it could be a big step forward in the fight against superbugs.</p>

<p>Title: "Attenborough: Oceans in Big Trouble"</p>
<p>Sir David Attenborough, a famous TV naturalist, has told Prince William that he is shocked by the damage some fishing methods are causing to the world's oceans. Attenborough said that what we have done to the deep ocean floor is "unspeakably awful" and that if we did the same thing on land, everyone would be very angry.</p>
<p>The world's countries are meeting for the first time in three years to discuss how to better protect the oceans, which are facing big threats from plastic pollution, climate change, and overfishing. The UN wants to get 60 countries to agree to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030.</p>
<p>Attenborough hopes that the leaders meeting at the UN conference will understand how important the oceans are to all of us. The ocean is crucial for the survival of all living things on the planet, providing 80% of the oxygen we breathe and supporting many economies.</p>
<p>However, some fishing practices, like bottom trawling, are causing a lot of damage to the ocean floor and marine life. Scientists and charities are worried that these practices will continue even in protected areas. They want the UN to ban bottom trawling in these areas to help fish stocks recover and protect the ocean.</p>
<p>The conference is also discussing the impact of climate change on the oceans, which are absorbing excess heat and greenhouse gases. Scientists warn that if the oceans were not absorbing this heat, the world would be much warmer, and many places would be uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Overall, the UN conference aims to find ways to protect the oceans and address the many threats they face. Sir David Attenborough's message is clear: we must take action to protect the oceans, which are essential for our survival.</p>

<p>Title: "Joshua Wong Charged with Foreign Collusion"</p>

<p>Joshua Wong, a well-known Hong Kong activist, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces to harm China's national security. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Wong was taken from prison to a court in Hong Kong, where he was formally charged. He is the second person in Hong Kong to be charged with this crime, after media tycoon Jimmy Lai.</p>
<p>The charge is related to Wong's activities with a former lawmaker, Nathan Law, and others. They are accused of asking foreign organizations and people to sanction China and Hong Kong. The court did not provide more details about the case.</p>
<p>Wong has been in prison since 2021 for his involvement in pro-democracy protests. He was a leader of the student group Scholarism and later co-founded the Demosisto party, which was disbanded after the national security law was passed in 2020.</p>
<p>The national security law was passed by China's parliament and allows for severe punishments, including life imprisonment, for crimes such as colluding with foreign forces. The law has been criticized by many countries, including the UK and the US, for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.</p>
<p>Wong's case has drawn international attention, with many human rights groups and politicians expressing concern about his treatment and the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Title: "US Brings Back Deported Salvadoran to Face Charges"</p>
<p>The US has brought back a 29-year-old Salvadoran man, Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported in March. He will face two federal criminal charges for participating in a trafficking conspiracy that moved undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>García was accused of playing a significant role in an alien smuggling ring, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants to the US. He was also accused of transporting members of the MS-13 gang, which is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the US.</p>
<p>García's lawyers have called the charges "preposterous" and said that the government's actions are an "abuse of power". They argue that García has never been convicted of any criminal offense, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The US government had previously alleged that García was a member of the MS-13 gang, which he has denied. The case has sparked a debate about immigration and the use of a wartime law to detain or deport people.</p>
<p>García will appear in court for an initial hearing, and a judge will determine if there are grounds to keep him detained ahead of his trial. His lawyers have requested a full and fair trial in front of the same immigration judge who heard the case in 2019.</p>

<p>Title: "Polo-loving drug lord exposed"</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at B1 level:</p>
<p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez was a man with two lives. On the surface, he was a successful businessman and a member of a prestigious polo club in London. He even met with members of the British royal family. However, in reality, Hafeez was a major drug trafficker known as "the Sultan." He controlled a vast network of drug suppliers and distributors across the world.</p>
<p>Hafeez would often inform the authorities about rival drug cartels, pretending to be a concerned citizen. However, his real motive was to eliminate his competitors. He was able to fool many people, including the authorities, with his fake persona.</p>
<p>However, his luck ran out when two of his associates met with an undercover agent from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Kenya. The agent was posing as a buyer from Colombia, and Hafeez's associates offered to sell him large quantities of heroin. The meeting was secretly filmed, and the footage was used as evidence against Hafeez.</p>
<p>Hafeez was eventually arrested and extradited to the US, where he pleaded guilty to conspiring to import drugs. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. The authorities were able to piece together evidence from seized devices and other sources to reveal Hafeez's true identity as a major drug trafficker.</p>
<p>Despite his attempts to fool everyone, Hafeez's double life eventually caught up with him, and he is now facing the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>Title: "The Last Customer"</p>

<p>In a narrow corner of downtown Chicago, nestled between a pawn shop and a dying flower store, stood Tavern Eclipse, a cozy old bar with warm lights and even warmer secrets. The owner, Mr. Henry Caldwell, was a retired detective with a limp in his leg, a scar over his brow, and an ear always tuned to the whispers of the city.</p>

<p>On a cold November evening, just before midnight, the bar was nearly empty. Only one patron remained—a nervous young man in a gray hoodie, sipping slowly from a bottle of ginger ale.</p>

<p>Henry wiped a glass and glanced at the boy. "Last call was fifteen minutes ago," he said gently.</p>

<p>The boy looked up. “I just need a place to sit. Five more minutes.”</p>

<p>Henry shrugged and turned on the TV behind the counter. The news was on.</p>

<p>“BREAKING: Authorities continue the search for the suspect in the Newberry Diamond Heist. The thief, believed to be a young man in his twenties, is armed and dangerous.”</p>

<p>The boy flinched.</p>

<p>Henry turned down the volume. "Tough city," he muttered.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. “I didn’t mean to… I didn’t think it would go that far.”</p>

<p>Henry raised an eyebrow. “You know, confessions usually come with a drink stronger than ginger ale.”</p>

<p>The boy sighed and reached into his pocket. Instead of a weapon, he pulled out a small velvet pouch. He placed it on the bar and pushed it toward Henry.</p>

<p>Inside was the Newberry Diamond—a flawless blue gem worth over three million dollars.</p>

<p>Henry stared, then chuckled. “You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to take it,” the boy said. “It was a dare. My brother said I couldn’t steal a piece of candy without being caught. I wanted to prove him wrong. Then… everything snowballed. I panicked. I ran. I’ve been running for two days.”</p>

<p>Henry leaned in. “So what now? You give it to me, and I hand it to the cops?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the boy. “You keep it. Sell it. Use the money. I just want to disappear.”</p>

<p>Henry took a deep breath. “Son, disappearing doesn’t work the way you think.”</p>

<p>The boy stood up. “I don’t care anymore. I’m done running.”</p>

<p>As he walked to the door, he paused and turned. “Thanks for listening. You’re the first person I’ve trusted in years.”</p>

<p>He left. Henry stood in silence for a long time. Then, he picked up the velvet pouch, looked inside again, and smiled. Not a warm smile—a wry, familiar one. The kind you wear when the world shows you its oldest tricks.</p>

<p>He limped into the back room and opened a safe. Inside were six identical velvet pouches.</p>

<p>He whispered, “Seven down. One more to go.”</p>

<p>Then he picked up his phone and dialed.</p>

<p>“Chief? It’s Caldwell. Yeah, another one took the bait. That’s the seventh decoy we’ve recovered. Same story. Same diamond. Same guilt. They never check if it’s real.”</p>

<p>He looked out the window, where the boy had vanished into the fog.</p>

<p>“Poor kids,” he said softly. “They always think they’re running from the law. Never realize they’re running into it.”</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Twist Explanation (à la O. Henry):</p>

<p>The boy thinks he’s giving the real stolen diamond to a kind bartender and escaping punishment. In truth, Henry is still a detective running a sting operation with fake diamonds, catching small-time thieves tricked into believing they have the real gem. The boy was never the true thief—just another decoy being used in a wider trap.</p>
