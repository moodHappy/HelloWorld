<p>Title: "Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Charged with Colluding with Foreign Forces"</p>
<p>Joshua Wong, a well-known Hong Kong activist, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces to harm China's national security. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Wong was taken from prison to a court in Hong Kong, where he was formally charged. He is the second person in Hong Kong to be charged with this crime, after media tycoon Jimmy Lai.</p>
<p>The charge is related to Wong's activities with a former lawmaker, Nathan Law, and others. They are accused of asking foreign organizations and people to sanction China and Hong Kong. The court did not provide more details about the case.</p>
<p>Wong has been in prison since 2021 for his involvement in pro-democracy protests. He was a leader of the student group Scholarism and later co-founded the Demosisto party, which was disbanded after the national security law was passed in 2020.</p>
<p>The national security law was passed by China's parliament and allows for severe punishments, including life imprisonment, for crimes such as colluding with foreign forces. The law has been criticized by many countries, including the UK and the US, for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.</p>
<p>Wong's case has drawn international attention, with many human rights groups and politicians expressing concern about his treatment and the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Title: "Boy Dies After Falling from Cliffs of Moher"</p>
<p>A 12-year-old boy from China died after falling from the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. The boy, Zhihan Zhao, was on holiday with his mother when the accident happened. He slipped in a puddle near the edge of the cliff and fell 214 meters to his death.</p>
<p>The boy's mother reported him missing when she couldn't find him on the trail. A French tourist saw the boy fall and told the police. A big search operation was started, but it took five days to find the boy's body in the sea.</p>
<p>The coroner said that the boy died from injuries caused by the fall. She also said that the boy's death was an accident and that he didn't shout or make any noise when he fell.</p>
<p>This is the second time someone has died after falling from the Cliffs of Moher in a short time. The trail has been partially closed due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>Title: "US Brings Back Deported Salvadoran to Face Charges"</p>
<p>The US has brought back a 29-year-old Salvadoran man, Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported in March. He will face two federal criminal charges for participating in a trafficking conspiracy that moved undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>García was accused of playing a significant role in an alien smuggling ring, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants to the US. He was also accused of transporting members of the MS-13 gang, which is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the US.</p>
<p>García's lawyers have called the charges "preposterous" and said that the government's actions are an "abuse of power". They argue that García has never been convicted of any criminal offense, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The US government had previously alleged that García was a member of the MS-13 gang, which he has denied. The case has sparked a debate about immigration and the use of a wartime law to detain or deport people.</p>
<p>García will appear in court for an initial hearing, and a judge will determine if there are grounds to keep him detained ahead of his trial. His lawyers have requested a full and fair trial in front of the same immigration judge who heard the case in 2019.</p>

<p>Title: "Polo-loving drug lord exposed"</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at B1 level:</p>
<p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez was a man with two lives. On the surface, he was a successful businessman and a member of a prestigious polo club in London. He even met with members of the British royal family. However, in reality, Hafeez was a major drug trafficker known as "the Sultan." He controlled a vast network of drug suppliers and distributors across the world.</p>
<p>Hafeez would often inform the authorities about rival drug cartels, pretending to be a concerned citizen. However, his real motive was to eliminate his competitors. He was able to fool many people, including the authorities, with his fake persona.</p>
<p>However, his luck ran out when two of his associates met with an undercover agent from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Kenya. The agent was posing as a buyer from Colombia, and Hafeez's associates offered to sell him large quantities of heroin. The meeting was secretly filmed, and the footage was used as evidence against Hafeez.</p>
<p>Hafeez was eventually arrested and extradited to the US, where he pleaded guilty to conspiring to import drugs. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. The authorities were able to piece together evidence from seized devices and other sources to reveal Hafeez's true identity as a major drug trafficker.</p>
<p>Despite his attempts to fool everyone, Hafeez's double life eventually caught up with him, and he is now facing the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>Title: "Trump-Musk Fallout"</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at the B1 level:</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are having a big argument. Trump is thinking about selling his Tesla car because of the fight. Musk said that Trump would have lost the election without his help, which made Trump very angry. Trump called Musk "the man who has lost his mind" and said he doesn't want to talk to him.</p>
<p>The argument started when Musk criticized Trump's spending bill. Trump then said that Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, get too much money from the government. Musk said that Trump is ungrateful and that he helped him win the election.</p>
<p>Some people think that the argument will end soon, but others think it will last a long time. Musk's father said that his son is standing up for what he believes in, but that he needs to learn to compromise.</p>
<p>Trump and Musk have had disagreements before, but this one is very public and intense. Both men have a lot of power and influence, and it's not clear who will win the argument.</p>

<p>Title: "The Last Customer"</p>

<p>In a narrow corner of downtown Chicago, nestled between a pawn shop and a dying flower store, stood Tavern Eclipse, a cozy old bar with warm lights and even warmer secrets. The owner, Mr. Henry Caldwell, was a retired detective with a limp in his leg, a scar over his brow, and an ear always tuned to the whispers of the city.</p>

<p>On a cold November evening, just before midnight, the bar was nearly empty. Only one patron remained—a nervous young man in a gray hoodie, sipping slowly from a bottle of ginger ale.</p>

<p>Henry wiped a glass and glanced at the boy. "Last call was fifteen minutes ago," he said gently.</p>

<p>The boy looked up. “I just need a place to sit. Five more minutes.”</p>

<p>Henry shrugged and turned on the TV behind the counter. The news was on.</p>

<p>“BREAKING: Authorities continue the search for the suspect in the Newberry Diamond Heist. The thief, believed to be a young man in his twenties, is armed and dangerous.”</p>

<p>The boy flinched.</p>

<p>Henry turned down the volume. "Tough city," he muttered.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. “I didn’t mean to… I didn’t think it would go that far.”</p>

<p>Henry raised an eyebrow. “You know, confessions usually come with a drink stronger than ginger ale.”</p>

<p>The boy sighed and reached into his pocket. Instead of a weapon, he pulled out a small velvet pouch. He placed it on the bar and pushed it toward Henry.</p>

<p>Inside was the Newberry Diamond—a flawless blue gem worth over three million dollars.</p>

<p>Henry stared, then chuckled. “You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to take it,” the boy said. “It was a dare. My brother said I couldn’t steal a piece of candy without being caught. I wanted to prove him wrong. Then… everything snowballed. I panicked. I ran. I’ve been running for two days.”</p>

<p>Henry leaned in. “So what now? You give it to me, and I hand it to the cops?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the boy. “You keep it. Sell it. Use the money. I just want to disappear.”</p>

<p>Henry took a deep breath. “Son, disappearing doesn’t work the way you think.”</p>

<p>The boy stood up. “I don’t care anymore. I’m done running.”</p>

<p>As he walked to the door, he paused and turned. “Thanks for listening. You’re the first person I’ve trusted in years.”</p>

<p>He left. Henry stood in silence for a long time. Then, he picked up the velvet pouch, looked inside again, and smiled. Not a warm smile—a wry, familiar one. The kind you wear when the world shows you its oldest tricks.</p>

<p>He limped into the back room and opened a safe. Inside were six identical velvet pouches.</p>

<p>He whispered, “Seven down. One more to go.”</p>

<p>Then he picked up his phone and dialed.</p>

<p>“Chief? It’s Caldwell. Yeah, another one took the bait. That’s the seventh decoy we’ve recovered. Same story. Same diamond. Same guilt. They never check if it’s real.”</p>

<p>He looked out the window, where the boy had vanished into the fog.</p>

<p>“Poor kids,” he said softly. “They always think they’re running from the law. Never realize they’re running into it.”</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Twist Explanation (à la O. Henry):</p>

<p>The boy thinks he’s giving the real stolen diamond to a kind bartender and escaping punishment. In truth, Henry is still a detective running a sting operation with fake diamonds, catching small-time thieves tricked into believing they have the real gem. The boy was never the true thief—just another decoy being used in a wider trap.</p>
