I was walking down the street when I saw a stray cat. It looked really hungry, so I decided to buy some food for it. The cat started eating and I sat down next to it. It didn't run away, so I thought it was friendly. I stroked its fur and it started purring. We just sat there for a while, enjoying the sunshine. I was thinking about my life, and the cat was just happy to have some food. Sometimes I feel like that cat, just wandering around without a clear direction. But in that moment, everything felt okay. The cat finished eating and walked away, but I kept sitting there, feeling a bit more at peace. I guess sometimes all we need is a little companionship and some food to keep going.
