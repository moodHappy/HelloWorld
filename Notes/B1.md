<p>Title: "Colombian Presidential Candidate Shot at Rally"</p>
<p>A Colombian presidential candidate, Miguel Uribe Turbay, was shot three times at a campaign event in the capital city of Bogota. He was shot twice in the head and once in the knee. The attack happened while Uribe was speaking to a small crowd in a park. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene.</p>
<p>Uribe's wife asked the nation to pray for his survival. The government and Uribe's party condemned the attack, saying it was a threat to democracy and freedom in Colombia. The US Secretary of State also condemned the shooting, calling it a "direct threat to democracy".</p>
<p>Uribe comes from a well-known political family in Colombia and has connections to the Liberal Party. His mother was a journalist who was killed in 1991 during a rescue attempt after being kidnapped by a drug cartel.</p>
<p>Uribe is currently in the hospital receiving treatment, and his supporters are gathered outside, waiting for news about his condition.</p>
