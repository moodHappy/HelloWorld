US President Donald Trump has signed a new travel ban, stopping people from 12 countries from entering the US. The countries include Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, and Somalia. The ban is because of national security risks. Seven more countries, including Cuba and Venezuela, will have some travel restrictions.

The ban starts on Monday and has no end date. Some people, like US residents and government employees, are exempt. Trump said the ban might change if the countries improve their security.

Democrats and human rights groups have criticized the ban, calling it "discriminatory" and "cruel". This is Trump's second travel ban, and it is expected to face legal challenges. The first ban, in 2017, was also criticized and was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court.
