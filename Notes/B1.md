<p>Title: "Iran and Israel Conflict"</p>
<p>There is a big fight between Iran and Israel. Iran sent missiles to Israel, and Israel sent planes to attack Iran. Many people are hurt, and some are dead. The leader of Israel, Netanyahu, is telling the people of Iran to stand up against their government. The United Nations is trying to stop the fighting, but it's not working yet. Many countries are worried about what might happen next. Iran is saying that Israel's attacks are "barbaric and criminal", and they want the United Nations to condemn Israel. The situation is very serious and could get worse if someone doesn't stop the fighting soon.</p>
