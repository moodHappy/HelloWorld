<p>Title: "US Sends National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Immigration Protests"</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has sent 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles because of violent protests against immigration raids. The protests started after US immigration agents arrested many people in the city. The clashes between protesters and police have been violent, with fireworks being thrown and tear gas being used.</p>
<p>The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, does not agree with Trump's decision. He thinks it will make the situation worse and is "purposefully inflammatory". Other Democrats also disagree with the decision, saying it's not needed and will cause more problems.</p>
<p>The National Guard is a special group of soldiers that usually help the state, but Trump has taken control of them. He says they are needed to keep order in Los Angeles. The situation is still very tense, with many people protesting and clashing with police.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles mayor says that the National Guard has not been deployed in the city, but the situation is still changing. Trump has thanked the National Guard for their work, but it's not clear if they have actually arrived in Los Angeles.</p>
