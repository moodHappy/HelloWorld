<p><strong>Iran rules out new nuclear talks until attacks stop</strong></p>
<p>Iran has said it will not resume talks over its nuclear programme while under attack, hours after Israel's defence minister warned of a "prolonged" conflict with the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met European diplomats in Geneva who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the US over his country's nuclear programme.</p>
<p>His Israeli counterpart, Eyal Zamir, said in a video address that his country should be ready for a "prolonged campaign" and warned of "difficult days ahead".</p>
<p>Fighting raged into the night with the Israeli military announcing a new wave of attacks against Iranian missile storage and launch infrastructure after Iran launched missiles towards central Israel.</p>
<p>Explosions were heard close to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Reports say a building was set on fire in central Israel by falling shrapnel.</p>
<p>Araghchi said Iran was ready to consider diplomacy only once Israel's "aggression is stopped".</p>
<p>Iran's nuclear programme was peaceful, he insisted, and Israel's attacks violated international law. Iran, he added, would continue to "exercise its legitimate right of self-defence".</p>
<p>"I make it crystal clear that Iran's defence capabilities are non-negotiable," he said.</p>
<p>Israel's ambassador to the UN accused Iran of having a "genocidal agenda" and posing an ongoing threat, adding that Israel would not stop targeting nuclear facilities until they were "dismantled".</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said Iran had a "maximum" of two weeks to avoid possible American air strikes, suggesting that he could take a decision before the 14-day deadline he set on Thursday.</p>
<p>"I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum," Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>The aim, he said, was to "see whether or not people come to their senses".</p>
<p>The US president was also dismissive of the talks between Araghchi and foreign ministers from the UK, France, Germany and the EU.</p>
<p>"Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe," Trump said. "They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this."</p>
<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that the US had provided a "short window of time" to resolve the crisis in the Middle East which was "perilous and deadly serious".</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the ministers had invited the Iranian minister to "consider negotiations with all sides, including the United States, without awaiting the cessation of strikes".</p>
<p>Barrot added that there could be "no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem" and warned that it was "dangerous to want to impose a regime change" in Iran.</p>
<p>Israel was also hit by a new round of Iranian strikes on Friday with the Israeli military reporting an attack of 20 missiles targeting Haifa.</p>
<p>One Israeli woman died of a heart attack, bringing the Israeli death toll since the conflict began to 25.</p>
<p>The Israel Defense Forces said they had attacked ballistic missile storage and launch sites in western Iran.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Israeli air strikes have destroyed Iranian military facilities and weapons, and killed senior military commanders and nuclear scientists.</p>
<p>Iran's health ministry said on Sunday that at least 224 people had been killed, while a human rights group put the unofficial death toll at 639 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Iran has launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel in response to the air strikes.</p>
