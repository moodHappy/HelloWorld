<p><strong>Crabs wear plastic shells â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Hermit crabs are little creatures from the beach. They are doing something different now.</p>
<p>They do not use normal shells. They like plastic ones. Scientists see this in pictures on the internet. They see pictures of 386 crabs which use plastic caps. Ten out of sixteen types of these crabs in warm places do this. The crabs may choose plastic because it is lighter. It smells different. Scientists want to know how this can change the crabs.</p>
<p>Shawn Miller takes many pictures of these crabs. He wants to help them. He tells people not to take away the shells they like on beaches. Plastic is not good for animals. There may be three times more plastic in oceans by 2060 than there is now.</p>
<p>Difficult words: shell (the hard home of crabs, snails, and other animals), cap (the cover of a bottle, pen, and other things).</p>
