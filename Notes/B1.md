<p>A very old condom is now in a museum in Amsterdam. It is almost 200 years old! The condom looks new and was never used. It is made from a part of a sheep. The condom has a funny picture on it. It shows a nun and three men from the church. Many people are going to the museum to see it. The museum bought it last year. It will be there until the end of November.</p>

<p>The condom is part of a show about old times. It tells us about love and health long ago. People then were afraid of getting sick or having babies they didn't want. This condom was probably from a special place in France. It was very rare and only rich people could buy it.</p>
