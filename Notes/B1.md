<p><strong>The US attacks Iran â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>The US and Israel hit three places in Iran: Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iran makes nuclear things in these places. The US drops big bombs from airplanes. The leaders say this is a strong attack, and it can bring peace.</p>
<p>Iran sends many rockets back to Israel. The defense stops most of them. Sixteen people are hurt. One warning sound does not work in a town.</p>
<p>An expert says that the attack is not right by international rules. He says Iran may work on its nuclear program secretly. He says talking is better than war.</p>
<p>Difficult words: peace (the time without a war or fight), defense (technologies and people which keep a country safe), secretly (when you do something and others do not know about it).</p>
