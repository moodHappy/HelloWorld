<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at the B1 level:</p>
<p>Recently, three events in China have caused a lot of discussion on the internet. They are about a Chinese student who graduated from Harvard University, a young actress who posted a photo of herself wearing expensive jewelry, and a doctor who was accused of cheating to get her job.</p>
<p>Many people in China are questioning how these individuals achieved their success. They think that it's not fair that some people have more opportunities than others because of their family connections.</p>
<p>The student, Jiang Yurong, gave a speech at Harvard's graduation ceremony, which was a proud moment for China. However, some people started to question how she got into Harvard, suggesting that she might have used her family's connections.</p>
<p>Jiang Yurong defended herself, saying that she worked hard to save money for her education and that she received a scholarship. However, many people are still unhappy and think that the system is unfair.</p>
<p>The actress, Huang Yangtianni, posted a photo of herself wearing expensive jewelry, which caused people to question how she could afford it. Her father, a former government official, denied any wrongdoing, but an investigation found that he might have been involved in corrupt activities.</p>
<p>The doctor, Dong Xiying, was accused of cheating to get her job at a hospital. An investigation found that she had indeed cheated and that her father was a high-ranking official at a state-owned company.</p>
<p>These events have caused a lot of discussion in China about fairness and equality. Many people feel that the system is unfair and that some people have more opportunities than others because of their family connections. The government has promised to address these issues and create a more equal society.</p>
<p>However, some experts think that these problems will continue to exist until China's economic inequality is solved. They believe that the public is not prepared for the slowing down of China's economy and that people are demanding that the government fulfill its promises of creating a more equal society.</p>
