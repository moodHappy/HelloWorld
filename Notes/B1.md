<p>Title: "War Crimes in Gaza: A Growing Concern for Governments"</p>
<p>There is a big war happening between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Many people, including children, have been killed or hurt. The war started when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people. Israel responded with strong military action, which has caused a lot of damage and deaths in Gaza.</p>
<p>The problem is that Israel is not following the rules of war, which are meant to protect civilians. These rules are called the Geneva Conventions. They say that even in war, civilians should be treated humanely and protected from harm.</p>
<p>Many countries, including those in Europe, are worried about what is happening in Gaza. They think that Israel's actions are wrong and might be considered war crimes. Some lawyers even believe that Israel's actions could be seen as genocide, which is a very serious crime.</p>
<p>The numbers of people killed or hurt in Gaza are very high. According to the ministry of health in Gaza, at least 54,607 Palestinians have been killed and 125,341 wounded since the war started. Many children have been killed or orphaned, and some have even lost limbs.</p>
<p>The international community is trying to help, but it's difficult because Israel is not allowing many aid shipments into Gaza. This has caused a big problem with food and medicine, and many people are suffering.</p>
<p>Some governments are speaking out against Israel's actions, but others are not. This could cause problems for them in the future if they are seen as supporting Israel's actions.</p>
<p>The situation in Gaza is very serious, and it's getting worse. Many people are calling for an end to the violence and for Israel to follow the rules of war.</p>
