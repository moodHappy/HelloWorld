* So sad to see this happen in Australia 
* Albanese getting booed is not surprising, he's been too soft on antisemitism
* Rest in peace to the victims, hope the gov takes real action to prevent this from happening again
* Why didn't the police do more to stop the attack? So many questions
* Chaya's speech was so powerful, she's a true hero 
* When will the gov learn to take hate speech seriously? 
* Gun control now! How many more lives will be lost before something changes?
