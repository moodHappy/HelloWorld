<p>Title: "Iran's Leader Loses Key Advisers in Israeli Strikes"</p>
<p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is facing a difficult time after several of his top military and security advisers were killed in Israeli air strikes. These advisers were important members of Khamenei's inner circle, which is made up of about 15-20 people who are extremely loyal to him and the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The loss of these key advisers has created big holes in Khamenei's inner circle and has raised concerns about the risk of strategic errors. Khamenei is 86 years old and has been in power since 1989. He is known for being very cautious and focused on maintaining the Islamic system of government in Iran.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Khamenei still has other important and influential advisers, including his son Mojtaba, who has become increasingly central to his decision-making process over the past 20 years. Mojtaba has built close ties with the Revolutionary Guards, which gives him added leverage across Iran's political and security apparatus.</p>
<p>The recent losses have also weakened the Revolutionary Guards, which is a powerful military organization that Khamenei has relied on for both internal security and regional strategy. The Guards answer directly to Khamenei, and their commanders play a major role in the state.</p>
<p>As Khamenei faces one of the most dangerous moments in the Islamic Republic's history, he is becoming increasingly isolated. The recent losses of key advisers in the region, including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, have further weakened his position.</p>
