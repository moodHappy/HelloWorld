<p>Title: "US Bombers Hit Iran's Nuclear Sites in Secret Mission"</p>
<p>The US has carried out a secret bombing mission against Iran's nuclear sites. The attack, called "Operation Midnight Hammer," used seven B-2 stealth bombers and multiple decoy flights to confuse Iranian defenses. The bombers flew from a US airbase in Missouri and traveled over the Atlantic Ocean, using powerful "bunker buster" bombs to hit Iran's nuclear enrichment facility at Fordo, which is buried deep underground.</p>
<p>The US Secretary of Defense said that the mission was a success and that the US had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime. However, the full impact of the attack is still unclear, and Iran has minimized the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>The US used multiple deception tactics, including decoy flights and fake targets, to confuse Iranian defenses. The bombers entered Iranian airspace and dropped their bombs on multiple targets, including the Fordo facility and a second nuclear facility at Natanz. The US also launched Tomahawk missiles from a submarine in the Arabian Sea to hit a nuclear site near Isfahan.</p>
<p>The attack was carried out in secret, with the US using multiple methods to avoid detection. The bombers flew under the cover of darkness, and the US used satellite images to assess the damage. The full extent of the damage is still unclear, but the US claims that the mission was a success.</p>
<p>Experts say that the attack was an "incredibly complicated and very sophisticated" operation that no other country could have performed. However, it is unclear if the attack will achieve its goal of permanently setting back Iran's nuclear program.</p>
