<p>Donald Trump, the US President, and Elon Musk, a very rich businessman, are having a big argument. They are both very powerful and have a lot of influence. The argument started because Musk criticized Trump's new law. Trump got angry and said he would stop giving money to Musk's companies, which would hurt his business.</p>

<p>Musk didn't back down and instead said that Trump should be removed from office. He also said that he would stop working with the government on some projects. Musk even made some serious accusations against Trump, but without any proof.</p>

<p>This argument is getting a lot of attention in the US and is making it hard for Trump to get his laws passed. Some people think that Musk could even help the Democrats, the opposing party, by giving them money and support.</p>

<p>It's not clear what will happen next, but it's likely that this argument will continue for a while. Trump has a few more years as president, but Musk is a very rich and influential person who will be around for a long time.</p>

<p>This argument is also affecting the stock market, with Tesla's shares going down by 14%. It's a big deal because Musk and Trump are two of the most powerful people in the US, and their argument is making a lot of noise in the country.</p>
