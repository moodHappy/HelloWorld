<p><strong>30 years since the Srebrenica killings – level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>People in Bosnia and Herzegovina remember a sad event. Thirty years ago, 8,000 men and boys die in Srebrenica.  Bosnian Serbs killed them. It was a very big crime.</p>
<p>Now, there is a special place in Potočari. It has a museum and a cemetery. This year, people will bury seven more bodies. These people are lost for a long time. Now, families can say goodbye. Many people come to the place to remember and show love.</p>
<p>Some people still say that the killings never happen. They say good things about the killers. But many people in Bosnia want peace. They want help to make a better life.</p>
<p>Difficult words: cemetery (a place where dead people are in the ground), bury (to put someone or something in the ground), peace (no fight or war).</p>
