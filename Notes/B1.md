<p>Title: "US to Evacuate Some Staff from Iraq Embassy due to Iran Tensions"</p>
<p>The US is evacuating some non-essential staff and their families from its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, because of increased security risks. The decision was made after US officials were informed that Israel was planning a possible military operation against Iran. The US is worried that Iran might retaliate against US targets in Iraq.</p>
<p>The US and Iran are still negotiating about Iran's nuclear program, but talks have been difficult. US President Donald Trump said the US does not want Iran to develop nuclear weapons and is trying to reach a deal to stop this. Iran claims its nuclear program is for energy generation, not for building nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The situation is tense, and the price of oil has increased due to concerns about potential supply problems. Around 2,500 US troops are currently based in Iraq. The US and Iran have had conflicts in the past, including a missile attack by Iran on US bases in Iraq in 2020.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has criticized Iran for not cooperating fully on its nuclear program. Iran has described the IAEA report as unbalanced and based on "forged documents" provided by Israel.</p>
