I was at my friend's party, having a great time. The music was loud and everyone was dancing. I saw her across the room, laughing with a group of friends. She caught my eye and smiled. I felt a little shy, but I went over to talk to her. We started dancing together and I found out we had a lot in common. Her name was Emily and she loved music and traveling, just like me. We talked for hours and before I knew it, the party was over. As we said our goodbyes, Emily gave me her number and we made plans to meet up again soon. I left the party feeling happy, knowing I had met someone special.
