As the sun set over Sydney, 19-year-old Maya gazed out at the Opera House, her mind elsewhere. In just a few hours, her younger sister would be cut off from the online world she knew. No more Instagram, no more TikTok, no more Snapchat. The government's ban on social media for under-16s was about to take effect.

Maya wondered how her sister would cope. Would she feel isolated from her friends, or would she find new ways to connect? As she pondered, a group of teenagers walked by, their faces aglow with the screens they held. They were the last generation to experience the unregulated online world, and soon they would be the only ones left.

Maya's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing. She glanced down to see a message from her sister, already anxious about the impending ban. "What am I supposed to do now?" the message read. Maya smiled wryly, remembering the countless hours she had spent online as a teenager. She typed out a response, "We'll find a way to make it work, sis. We always do."
