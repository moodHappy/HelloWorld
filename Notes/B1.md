I was walking home when I saw a suspicious guy lurking around my flat. I quickened my pace, my heart beating fast. As I approached, he slipped away into the shadows. I unlocked the door and rushed inside, calling out to my flatmate, but there was no answer. Everything seemed normal, but I knew I'd seen someone. I checked the living room, kitchen, and my room, but nothing was out of place. Then, I noticed a small piece of paper on the floor with a cryptic message: "They're watching you." I felt a chill run down my spine. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I spun around, but there was no one there. That's when I saw it - a hidden camera in the corner, its lens staring back at me. I knew then I wasn't alone.
