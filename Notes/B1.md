It was freezing outside, the coldest winter in years. I wrapped myself up in my thickest coat, still shivering as I walked to the bus stop. The wind was biting, it felt like it was cutting right through my scarf. When I got to work, the heating was on full blast, it was like walking into a warm hug. My colleagues were all chatting about their plans for the weekend, but I just wanted to get through the day. I made a cup of hot coffee and sat at my desk, feeling the warmth spread through my hands. As I sipped, I watched the snowflakes falling gently outside, it was actually quite pretty. The cold wasn't so bad when I was inside, sipping my coffee and watching the snow.
