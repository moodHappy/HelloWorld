As the sun set over the tranquil Buddhist temple, a sense of serenity filled the air. The scent of incense and flowers wafted through the courtyard, where a coffin lay waiting for the cremation ceremony. But amidst the somber atmosphere, a faint knock echoed through the silence. It was a sound that would change everything. 

Inside the coffin, a woman's eyes flickered open, her gaze clouded by the darkness. She was met with the scent of wood and the feeling of confinement. With a surge of adrenaline, she summoned all her strength and knocked again, her fingers barely making a sound. 

The knock grew louder, more insistent, until it was heard by the temple staff. The coffin was opened, and a gasp of shock filled the air as the woman's eyes locked onto the faces of the people surrounding her. She was alive. 

As the news spread, the temple's abbot rushed to her side, his face etched with concern. The woman was quickly whisked away to the hospital, where doctors worked to stabilize her condition. The mystery of her supposed death began to unravel, revealing a tale of mistaken assumptions and a family's desperate hope for closure. 

But for the woman, the journey was far from over. As she lay in her hospital bed, surrounded by the beeping of machines and the sterile smell of medicine, she couldn't help but wonder: what had happened during those lost hours, and how had she come so close to being lost forever?
