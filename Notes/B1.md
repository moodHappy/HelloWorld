<p><strong>Fake Charlie Hebdo cover â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Some people show a fake magazine cover on the internet. This Charlie Hebdo magazine cover says that Moldova has a new religion. The picture shows LGBT people and a priest.</p>
<p>But this is not a real magazine. The real one talks about something else. People use this fake picture to hurt the LGBT community. They also say police are bad to people who like family things. But this is not true. Police only stop bad people.</p>
<p>A group from the EU says this is a big lie. It wants people to be angry at LGBT people. But many LGBT people love their church and live in peace with their faith.</p>
<p>Difficult words: cover (the front page of a magazine), religion (when many people believe in a god), priest (a person who works in a church), lie (something what is not true)</p>
<p>You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.</p>
