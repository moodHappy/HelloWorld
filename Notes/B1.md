<p>The Autumn Plan</p>

<p>It was a crisp October morning when Emma slipped on the porch steps and took a sudden tumble into the pile of leaves her brother had just raked.</p>

<p>“Careful!” he called with a grin, offering a hand. “You’re lucky I didn’t designate that pile as off-limits.”</p>

<p>Emma laughed and brushed off a shred of leaf stuck to her sweater. They were part of a small contingent of volunteers helping to prepare the old community orchard for its fall reopening.</p>

<p>Their task was to prune the overgrown trees, remove dead branches, and gather apples—still a staple crop in their small town. The mayor had laid out a rigorous plan: five days of hard work with strict schedules, safety rules, and even apple-sorting protocols.</p>

<p>By noon, the air was filled with the brisk scent of cut branches and ripe fruit. Emma bit into an apple, its flavor potent and sweet.</p>

<p>“We’ve got just enough time to finish the last row,” her brother said, tossing her a pair of gloves.</p>

<p>With a nod, Emma turned toward the trees, ready to get back to work—careful not to take another tumble.</p>
