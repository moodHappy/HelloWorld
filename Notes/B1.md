The Israeli military has found the bodies of two Israeli-American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

Their bodies were discovered in the Khan Younis area of Gaza and brought back to Israel for identification.

There are still 56 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, with at least 20 believed to be alive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the military for their efforts and promised to continue working to bring back all the hostages. The couple's family expressed relief that their bodies had been found and could be given a proper burial. The Israeli military will continue to work to bring back all the hostages, both living and dead.
