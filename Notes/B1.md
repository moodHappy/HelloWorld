<p><strong>美国法院允许特朗普继续控制洛杉矶国民警卫队 --- US court allows Trump to keep control of National Guard in LA</strong></p>
<p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles, despite objections from city leaders and California Governor Gavin Newsom.
美国上诉法院裁定，尽管遭到洛杉矶市领导人和加州州长加文·纽瑟姆的反对，唐纳德·特朗普总统仍可以控制他部署到洛杉矶的国民警卫队。</p>
<p>Trump deployed the troops in response to widespread protests against his immigration crackdown. Local officials called it an unnecessary provocation.
特朗普部署军队是为了回应针对其移民镇压行动的广泛抗议。当地官员称这是不必要的挑衅 。</p>
<p>A three-judge panel on Thursday said he was within his rights to order the troops into service to "protect federal personnel... [and] property". Trump called it a "big win".
周四，由三位法官组成的合议庭表示，特朗普有权下令军队服役，以“保护联邦人员……[和]财产”。特朗普称这是一场“重大胜利”。</p>
<p>The decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally when mobilising the troops.
该判决推翻了下级法院法官的裁决，该法官认定特朗普在调动军队时存在非法行为。</p>
<p>In that earlier ruling, Judge Charles Breyer said Trump "did not" follow the law set by Congress on the deployment of a state's National Guard.
在先前的裁决中，法官查尔斯·布雷耶表示，特朗普“没有”遵守国会关于部署国民警卫队的法律。</p>
<p>"His actions were illegal... He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith," he wrote in his decision.
他在决定中写道：“他的行为是非法的……因此，他必须立即将加州国民警卫队的控制权移交给加州州长。”</p>
<p>The judge however stayed the order until 13 June to give the Trump administration time to appeal against it, which it did almost immediately after.
然而，法官将该命令暂缓执行至 6 月 13 日，以便特朗普政府有时间提出上诉 ，而特朗普政府几乎在上诉后立即提起了上诉。</p>
<p>"This is much bigger than Gavin [Newsom], because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done," Trump wrote on social media after the decision.
特朗普在决定公布后在社交媒体上写道：“这比加文·纽瑟姆的判决要大得多，因为在全美各地，如果我们的城市和人民需要保护，那么如果州和地方警察无论出于何种原因无法完成工作，我们就会为他们提供保护。”</p>
<p>He also congratulated the court, adding: "America is proud of you tonight!"
他还向法庭表示祝贺，并补充道：“今晚美国为你们感到骄傲！”</p>
<p>The 38-page ruling, however, said the judges disagreed with the president on the merits of the legal challenge against his use of the National Guard. It said his decision to use the troops was not "completely insulated from judicial review".
然而，这份长达 38 页的裁决称，法官们不同意总统关于动用国民警卫队的法律挑战的实质内容 。裁决称，总统动用军队的决定并非“完全不受司法审查 ”。</p>
<p>Newsom responded to the decision, saying the court "rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court.
纽森对这一判决作出回应，称法院“正确地驳回了特朗普的说法，即他可以对国民警卫队为所欲为，而不必向法庭解释。</p>
<p>"We will not let this authoritarian use of military soldiers against citizens go unchecked", he wrote on X, adding: "Donald Trump is not a king and not above the law."
他在 X 上写道：“我们不会让这种对公民使用军队的专制行为不受制止 ”，并补充道：“唐纳德·特朗普不是国王，也不能凌驾于法律之上。”</p>
<p>The court's decision allows for the continued deployment of around 4,000 troops to Los Angeles. The Trump administration says they have been protecting federal immigration agents and federal property during raids.
法院的裁决允许继续向洛杉矶部署约4000名士兵。特朗普政府表示，他们在突袭期间一直在保护联邦移民局人员和联邦财产。</p>
<p>It said it took over California's National Guard to restore order and to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as they conducted raids across Los Angeles to detain people they believed were in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Trump also ordered 700 Marines to the city, despite Newsom's objections.</p>
<p>The National Guard was last deployed by a president without a governor's consent during the civil rights era more than 50 years ago.</p>
