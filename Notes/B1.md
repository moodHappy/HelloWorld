US President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping had a phone call on Thursday. This was their first call since Trump became president. The two countries are in a trade war, but they agreed to stop fighting for a while. However, the agreement seems to be breaking down.

The Chinese government said the two leaders talked on the phone, but they didn't give any details. The call happened at a time when tensions between the US and China are rising again. Last month, representatives from both countries met in Geneva and agreed to pause the trade war.

However, Trump wrote on social media that Xi Jinping is "very tough" and it's hard to make a deal with him. The US government is accusing China of breaking the agreement by limiting the export of important minerals called rare earths. These minerals are used in many American industries, including car manufacturing and technology.

China controls most of the world's rare earth market and is using it as a way to pressure the US. The US government is planning to cancel some Chinese students' visas and stop selling certain parts and software to China.

China denies breaking the agreement and says the US is making things worse. The White House hasn't commented on the situation yet.
