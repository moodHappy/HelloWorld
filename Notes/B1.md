<p>Title: "Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Charged with Colluding with Foreign Forces"</p>
<p>Joshua Wong, a well-known Hong Kong activist, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces to harm China's national security. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Wong was taken from prison to a court in Hong Kong, where he was formally charged. He is the second person in Hong Kong to be charged with this crime, after media tycoon Jimmy Lai.</p>
<p>The charge is related to Wong's activities with a former lawmaker, Nathan Law, and others. They are accused of asking foreign organizations and people to sanction China and Hong Kong. The court did not provide more details about the case.</p>
<p>Wong has been in prison since 2021 for his involvement in pro-democracy protests. He was a leader of the student group Scholarism and later co-founded the Demosisto party, which was disbanded after the national security law was passed in 2020.</p>
<p>The national security law was passed by China's parliament and allows for severe punishments, including life imprisonment, for crimes such as colluding with foreign forces. The law has been criticized by many countries, including the UK and the US, for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.</p>
<p>Wong's case has drawn international attention, with many human rights groups and politicians expressing concern about his treatment and the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.</p>
