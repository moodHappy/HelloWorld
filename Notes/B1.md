<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at the B1 level:</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has made a new travel ban for people from 12 countries. This ban is different from the one he made in 2017, which had many problems and was taken to court. The new ban seems to be more careful and tries to avoid the mistakes of the old one.</p>
<p>The 12 countries affected by the ban are mainly in the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean. Trump says these countries have problems with terrorism and people staying in the US after their visas expire.</p>
<p>Lawyers think the new ban is more legal than the old one because it explains who is exempt and applies to more people. However, some people think the ban is still unfair and might hurt people from certain countries.</p>
<p>Trump's first travel ban caused many protests and was taken to court. The new ban seems to be more careful, but it has already been criticized by some countries and lawyers. They think it might affect students and people who want to visit the US.</p>
<p>The countries affected by the ban include Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia. Trump says the ban is necessary to keep the US safe, but some people think it is unfair and might hurt innocent people.</p>
