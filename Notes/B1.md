<p>Here is a summary of the article in simple English at B1 level:</p>
<p>Donald Trump, the leader of the United States, and Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, used to have a good relationship. However, over the past 10 days, they have had a big disagreement that has become very public.</p>
<p>It started when Musk said he was disappointed with Trump's new bill on taxes and spending. Trump said he was not happy with some parts of the bill, but he was excited about other parts, like tax cuts.</p>
<p>Musk then announced that he would be leaving his job as a special government employee. Trump said that Musk was not really leaving and would continue to work with the White House.</p>
<p>However, things got worse when Musk attacked Trump's bill again, calling it "massive, outrageous, and pork-filled." Trump defended his bill, saying that many false statements were being made about it.</p>
<p>The two men continued to argue on social media, with Musk saying that Trump's bill would increase the deficit and debt ceiling. Trump said that Musk was upset because subsidies for electric vehicles would be cut, affecting Musk's businesses.</p>
<p>The argument escalated, with Musk saying that Trump had changed and was no longer the same person who had criticized government spending in the past. Trump said that Musk had gone crazy and was wearing thin, and that he had asked him to leave the White House.</p>
<p>Musk even suggested that Trump might be involved in a scandal with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump denied this and said that Musk was just trying to distract from his own problems.</p>
<p>In the end, Trump said that he was not interested in speaking to Musk, and the White House said that there were no plans for the two men to talk. The feud between Trump and Musk has been very public and has gotten a lot of attention in the media.</p>
