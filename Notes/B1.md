The smoke had barely cleared from the charred remains of the building when the weight of William's actions settled in. He had helped some of his neighbors escape, but the voices of those he couldn't save still lingered in his mind. As he walked away from the ruins, the smell of burning plastic and wood clung to his clothes, a constant reminder of what he had witnessed.

He thought of the couple he had dragged to safety, their faces etched with fear as they stumbled through the darkness. He thought of the domestic worker who had called out for help, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames. And he thought of the ones he couldn't save, their faces forever etched in his memory.

The label of "hero" felt like a heavy burden, one that he didn't deserve. He had simply reacted, driven by instinct and a desire to help those in need. But as he looked out at the sea of faces, all searching for answers and comfort, he knew that he had to speak out. He had to tell his story, no matter how painful it was, in the hope that it might bring some semblance of justice to those who had lost so much.

With a deep breath, William began to recount the events of that fateful night, his voice shaking as he relived the horror. But with each word, he felt a sense of purpose growing within him. He would not let the memories of that night define him, but he would use them to drive change, to ensure that such a tragedy would never happen again. The fire may have taken everything from him, but it would not take his voice.
