<p>Title: "US President Deploys National Guard to Los Angeles"</p>
<p>There are big problems in Los Angeles, California. The US President, Donald Trump, has sent the National Guard to help with the situation. This is because there have been clashes between people and the police over immigration raids. The police have been arresting many undocumented migrants, which has made a lot of people angry.</p>
<p>People have been protesting and throwing things at the police. The police have used tear gas and other methods to try to control the situation. The President says he is sending the National Guard to help keep everything safe. However, the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, does not think this is a good idea. He says it will only make things worse.</p>
<p>The National Guard is a group of soldiers who can be called to help in emergency situations. They will be in Los Angeles for a while to try to keep everything under control. The situation is still developing, and it is not clear what will happen next.</p>
