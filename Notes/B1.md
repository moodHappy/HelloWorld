The rain fell softly on the small village, casting a gloomy shadow over the red and white building that stood like a monolith, a testament to the darkness that lurked within its walls. Baobao's heart still racing, she couldn't help but think of the early morning drills, the locked gates, and the constant fear that gripped her every waking moment at the Lizheng Quality Education School.

As she walked through the deserted streets, the smell of wet soil wafted through the air, transporting her back to the days when she was trapped in a living nightmare. The memories still lingered, etched in her mind like a scar that refused to heal.

She remembered the day her mother took her to the school, the promises of a better life, of discipline and obedience. But what she got was a regime of terror, of beatings and abuse, of being forced to comply with the whims of the instructors. The thought of it still made her skin crawl.

Baobao's story was not an isolated one. There were many others like her, forced into these schools, subjected to physical and sexual abuse, their minds broken by the relentless onslaught of "education." The scars ran deep, the trauma lingering long after they had escaped the clutches of their tormentors.

As she walked, the rain drumming against her umbrella, Baobao couldn't help but wonder how many others were still trapped, still suffering in silence. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder that she was not alone, that there were many more like her, waiting to be heard, waiting to be free.

The red and white building loomed in the distance, a haunting reminder of the horrors that lay within. Baobao quickened her pace, the rain swirling around her like a vortex, pulling her towards a future that was uncertain, but hopefully, free from the shadows of her past.
