<p>Title: "Iran Bans Dog Walking in Many Cities"</p>
<p>Iran has made a new rule that stops people from walking their dogs in many cities. This rule is because of concerns about public order and health. The government also does not want people to transport dogs in cars.</p>
<p>In Iran, having a dog as a pet is not widely accepted. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, dogs were seen as "unclean" and a symbol of Western culture. However, many young people in Iran are now keeping dogs as pets, which is seen as a way to rebel against the strict rules of the government.</p>
<p>Some cities in Iran, like Isfahan and Kerman, have already started enforcing this new rule. People who walk their dogs in public might face legal action.</p>
<p>Even though there is no national law that bans owning dogs, local authorities often make rules that are enforced by the police. Some people have been arrested and had their dogs taken away for walking them in public.</p>
<p>Many Iranians are finding ways to walk their dogs without getting caught, like walking them at night or in secret areas. The government views keeping pets as un-Islamic and sees it as a threat to public health and safety.</p>
<p>Critics think the government should focus on more important issues like violent crime instead of targeting dog owners. They also believe that this rule is an attack on personal freedom.</p>
