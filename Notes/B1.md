<p>Elon Musk, a very rich businessman, said he is sorry for some messages he posted about US President Donald Trump. Musk and Trump had a big argument on social media. Musk was unhappy with Trump's tax plan and called it a "disgusting abomination". He also made some strong claims about Trump that were not true.</p>
<p>Trump was not happy with Musk's messages and said he had "lost his mind". Trump even threatened to cancel Musk's big government contracts. Many people, including some Republicans, think Musk and Trump should make up. But some Democrats are enjoying the argument between the two men.</p>
<p>Musk has now deleted some of his messages, including one that called for Trump's impeachment. He also said he went too far with his posts.
