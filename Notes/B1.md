<p>Title: "Trump Stopped Israel from Killing Iran's Leader"</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump stopped Israel from killing Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This information was given by three US officials to a news organization.</p>
<p>According to one official, Trump told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that killing Khamenei was "not a good idea". Trump has not publicly commented on this report.</p>
<p>This conversation happened after Israel attacked Iran on Friday. Israel and Iran have been attacking each other for three days.</p>
<p>Netanyahu did not confirm or deny the report when asked about it in an interview. He said, "There are many conversations that never happened and were reported incorrectly. I don't want to talk about these things."</p>
<p>An Israeli official said that Israel does not usually kill political leaders and focuses on nuclear and military targets.</p>
<p>The US will continue to support Israel, Trump said before leaving for a meeting in Canada. He also said that he could stop the fighting between Israel and Iran, just like he stopped the fighting between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Talks between the US and Iran about nuclear issues were cancelled due to the fighting. Iran said it would not talk about stopping the fighting while it was still being attacked by Israel.</p>
<p>Trump warned Iran that if it attacks the US, the US will respond with great force.</p>
