US President Donald Trump has announced a travel ban affecting 12 countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East. The countries are: Afghanistan, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. 

The reasons for the ban include national security concerns, alleged breaking of US visa rules, and lack of cooperation from the countries in accepting deported nationals. Some countries are also accused of being "terrorist safe havens" or having high visa overstay rates.

Seven other countries face partial restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The ban will come into force on Monday.
