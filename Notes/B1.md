The US has deployed about 100 Stryker vehicles, used in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, to the US-Mexico border. The vehicles are part of a large military presence, including over 8,000 soldiers, spy planes, and drones, aimed at stopping illegal immigration. However, the number of crossings has slowed to a trickle, raising questions about the need for such a large military presence.

The Trump administration has been accused of bypassing laws that prevent the military from participating in domestic law enforcement. The military has created "National Defense Areas" along the border, allowing them to patrol and detain migrants. Critics argue that this is an overreach of military power and that the decline in crossings does not justify such measures. The administration argues that the measures are necessary for national security.
