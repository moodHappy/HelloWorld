<p>Title: "Mass Protests Against Trump Across the US"</p>
<p>There were big protests against President Donald Trump in many cities across the United States. A group called "No Kings" organized these protests. They were against Trump's military parade in Washington DC, which was held to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US Army.</p>
<p>Many people, including lawmakers, union leaders, and activists, gave speeches in cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Houston. They were waving American flags and holding signs that criticized Trump.</p>
<p>The protests were also against Trump's immigration policies. Some people said that Trump's policies are "evil" and that they separate families. There were some violent confrontations between protesters and the National Guard in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Despite the big protests, some people still support Trump's policies. A recent survey found that 54% of Americans agree with Trump's plan to deport immigrants who are in the US illegally.</p>
<p>The "No Kings" protests were also against Trump's use of presidential power. Some people think that Trump is acting like a king and not listening to the people.</p>
<p>The military parade in Washington DC was expensive, costing between $25 million and $45 million. Some people thought it was a waste of money, but others saw it as a way to honor the military and thank them for their service.</p>
