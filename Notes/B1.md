Title: Australia Bans Under-16s from Using Social Media

The Australian government has made a new rule that stops children under 16 from using social media. This is the first time a country has done this. The government wants to protect children from bad things they might see on social media, like mean messages or pictures that can hurt their health. Many children in Australia use social media, and some have seen bad things or been bullied online. 

The new rule starts on December 10 and affects many social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. These companies must make sure children under 16 cannot use their platforms. If they don't, they could be fined a lot of money. The government is encouraging companies to use different methods to check users' ages, like government IDs or face recognition. 

Some people think this new rule might not work because children can find ways to get around it. Others are worried that it will stop children from using social media safely and that it might not really reduce online harm. The government says it will keep checking the list of affected platforms and consider adding more if needed. 

Other countries are watching to see how this new rule works. Some countries have tried different ways to limit children's use of social media, but no one has banned it completely like Australia. The Australian government says it will protect children's personal information and make sure companies don't use it for anything else. 

Social media companies are not happy about the new rule and say it will be hard to implement. Some are already planning to close accounts of teenagers before the rule starts. Others are looking for ways to get around the ban, like using virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their location.
