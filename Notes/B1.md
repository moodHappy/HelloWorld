<p>US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are having a big argument. Last week, Musk left his job helping the US government. Now, he is strongly criticizing Trump's spending plans. Trump said he is "very disappointed" in Musk.</p>
<p>Musk used his social media platform, X, to attack Trump. He even suggested that Trump might be connected to the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but he didn't provide any evidence. Trump responded by saying Musk "went CRAZY" and threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies.</p>
<p>This argument is happening on two different social media platforms: X, owned by Musk, and Truth Social, owned by Trump. Some people think Trump stayed away from X because he didn't want to be controlled by Musk.</p>
<p>The argument is affecting the stock price of Tesla, Musk's electric car company. It dropped by 14% and is now below $1 trillion in value.</p>
<p>Some experts think this argument might actually help the Tesla brand in the long run because people in the US are very forgiving. However, it's not clear how this will affect Musk's personal image.</p>
<p>The situation is still developing, and it's not clear what will happen next.</p>
