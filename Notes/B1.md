<p>Title: "US and China Agree on Trade Deal Framework"</p>
<p>The US and China have agreed on a framework for a trade deal after two days of talks in London. US President Donald Trump said the deal is "done" but needs final approval from him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The agreement includes China supplying the US with rare earth metals, which are important for modern technology. In return, the US will allow Chinese students to study at American universities.</p>

<p>The agreement is subject to final approval from Trump and Xi, but it is seen as a major breakthrough in the trade talks. The US and China have been working towards a trade deal for some time, and this agreement is a significant step forward.</p>
