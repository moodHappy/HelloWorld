<p>Title: "Healer Uses Snake Bites to Treat Sick People"</p>
<p>There is a man from the Philippines named Rosalio Culit. He says he can heal sick people by letting them get bitten by poisonous snakes. These snakes are called pit vipers. Rosalio claims that the snake's venom can cure many illnesses. He discovered this by accident when one of his pet snakes bit him, and he felt better after that.</p>
<p>Rosalio has been doing this for many years and has become famous for it. He even sells a special wine that has snake venom in it. However, experts say that there is no proof that the snake's venom can actually cure illnesses, and it can be dangerous for some people. Rosalio's daughter says that the snakes he uses are not deadly, but experts still think it's not a good idea. Many people are talking about Rosalio and his unusual way of healing.</p>
