<p>Unrest in Los Angeles over Immigration Raids</p>
<p>The US President, Donald Trump, has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles to deal with unrest over immigration raids on undocumented migrants. The decision was made after clashes broke out between local law enforcement and protesters against the raids. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal agents carried out operations in the city, resulting in 118 arrests this week, including 44 on Friday.</p>
<p>The clashes have been concentrated in predominantly Latino areas of LA county.</p>
<p>Protests have been ongoing, with demonstrators launching fireworks towards police lines and officers firing pepper-spray projectiles in response.</p>
<p>The LA County Sheriff's Department declared an unlawful assembly in an attempt to disperse demonstrators "without any violence".</p>
<p>Reactions to the Deployment</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized Trump's decision, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and stating that it will only escalate tensions. He also accused the Trump administration of "sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate". The state's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, also criticized the deployment, saying it was "unnecessary and counterproductive".</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, also weighed in, saying that "weaponizing protest to justify federal crackdowns is a dangerous precedent".</p>
<p>Congresswoman Sara Jacobs described the move as "an unnecessary escalation" and called on the president to reconsider.</p>
<p>The Role of the National Guard</p>
<p>The National Guard is a reserve force that usually operates at the state level. However, President Trump has used a provision that allows him to take control of the Guard by federalizing it. The law states that this can only be done in certain circumstances, such as when the US is invaded or in danger of being invaded, or when there is a rebellion against the authority of the US government.</p>
<p>The interim US attorney for the Central District of California said that the National Guard is needed to "regain order" in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said that active duty Marines are on "high alert" and will be mobilized if violence continues.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Mayor, Karen Bass, has said that the National Guard has not been deployed in the city of Los Angeles, despite Trump's announcement. The situation is still unfolding, with reports of ongoing protests and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Trump has thanked the National Guard for a "job well done", despite the BBC not being able to verify whether the Guard has actually arrived in LA.</p>
