<p>US President Donald Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles to quell unrest over immigration raids on undocumented migrants. The decision comes after clashes between protesters and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal agents in the predominantly Latino district of Paramount.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Mayor, Karen Bass, has stated that the National Guard has not been deployed in the city, but a federal official has confirmed that the troops will arrive within 24 hours. California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized the decision, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and stating that it will only escalate tensions. He also accused the Trump administration of "sowing chaos" to justify a federal crackdown.</p>
<p>The clashes began after ICE conducted raids across the city, resulting in 118 arrests. Protests erupted in the Westlake District and south LA, with demonstrators gathering outside the Federal Building in downtown LA. The LA County Sheriff's Department declared an unlawful assembly in an attempt to disperse protesters.</p>
<p>Some of the key events that led to the deployment of the National Guard include:</p>
<p>Immigration raids carried out by ICE across LA</p>
<p>Clashes between protesters and ICE federal agents in Paramount</p>
<p>Protests outside the Federal Building in downtown LA</p>
<p>Unlawful assembly declared by the LA County Sheriff's Department</p>
<p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has stated that active duty Marines are on "high alert" and will be mobilized if violence continues. Trump has thanked the National Guard for a "job well done", despite the fact that their deployment has not been verified. The situation remains ongoing, with reports of protests and clashes continuing in the area.</p>
<p>The deployment of the National Guard has been met with criticism from Democrats, including Congresswoman Sara Jacobs and Sen Alex Padilla, who have called it an "unnecessary escalation". The move has also raised concerns about the militarization of communities and the potential for violence to escalate.</p>
