<p>Title: "Israel Attacks Iran's Nuclear Sites"</p>
<p>Israel launched a big attack on Iran on Friday, hitting its nuclear sites and military leaders. Iran's top military commander, Hossein Salami, was killed in the attack. Israel said the attack, called "Operation Rising Lion", was meant to stop Iran's threat to Israel. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Iran was getting close to making nuclear weapons and that this was a big danger to Israel.</p>
<p>The US said it was not involved in the attack. Iran promised to respond strongly to the Israeli attack. The international community is worried about the escalation of violence in the region.</p>
<p>Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but many countries are not convinced. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently said Iran was not following the rules and had a big stockpile of enriched uranium. This has raised concerns that Iran is working on nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The situation is serious, and many countries are watching closely. The attack has caused global oil prices to rise, affecting the economy.</p>
