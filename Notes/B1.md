<p><strong>Budapest Pride 2025 – level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Many people go to the Budapest Pride. The government bans the march, but the people come anyway. They want to help LGBTQ+ people. Some people come for the first time. Greta Thunberg comes, too. She says that the ban is not good.</p>
<p>Some other people make a far-right march. The police say yes to them. The police keep the groups apart. It is safe. Péter Magyar, the leader of the opposition party, is not there. He is with his sons. He writes a nice message to all people.</p>
<p>Magyar talks about money, hospitals, and schools. The government wants him to talk about Pride. He does not. Pride ends with no big problems. People are happy and strong.</p>
<p>Difficult words: ban (a rule which stops something), march (when many people walk along roads as a form of protest), far-right (people with strong political ideas), opposition (a big political party which is not in a government).</p>
