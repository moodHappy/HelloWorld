<p>Title: "Russia Launches Big Drone Attack on Ukraine's Kharkiv"</p>
<p>Russia has made a big drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. At least three people were killed and 21 were hurt. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said Russia sent 48 drones, two missiles, and four gliding bombs to the city. Many buildings were damaged.</p>
<p>This attack happened after Ukraine made a big drone attack on Russian airfields. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is unhappy that Western leaders are not doing enough to stop Russia. He thinks they are helping Russia by not taking action.</p>
<p>Russia's President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a response to Ukraine's "terrorism". US President Donald Trump said Putin told him that Russia would react strongly to Ukraine's attack.</p>
<p>The fighting between Ukraine and Russia is getting worse. Both sides are making big attacks, and many people are getting hurt or killed. The international community is calling for a ceasefire and talks, but nothing has happened yet.</p>
