<p><strong>New Year's Eve 2025 live: Celebrations begin as 2026 kicks off in part of Kiribati - BBC News</strong></p>
<p>The island of Kiritimati is welcoming in the new year - the first place in the world do so.</p>
<p>It's part of the Pacific Ocean nation Kiribati, located south of Hawaii and north east of Australia. It is made up of several atolls - ring-shaped coral reefs - and spans almost 4,000km from east to west.</p>
<p>Kiribati - pronounced Kiribass - became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. Home to the South Pacific's largest marine reserve, many of the atolls are inhabited; most of them are very low-lying and at risk from rising sea levels as a result of global warming.</p>
<p>The archipelago has a population of about 116,000. Despite being almost directly south of Hawaii, Kiribati celebrates New Year a whole day earlier.</p>
<p>The atoll Kiritimati - also known as Christmas Island - has officially welcomed in 2026, becoming the first place in the world to do so!</p>
<p>Other parts of the Pacific nation of Kiribati will see in the new year over the next few hours.</p>

<p>Bryant and Waata are counting down to 2026 on the beach</p>
<p>Whilst many across the world wait hours until the clock strikes midnight, one atoll in Kiribati is already just minutes away from welcoming 2026.</p>
<p>Kiritimati (GMT+14), also known as Christmas Island, is known as the first place in the world to celebrate the new year.</p>
<p>Bryant Dunn, a fly fishing businessman from the US, is celebrating the new year there with his partner Waata Binoka Randolph - who was born and raised in Kiritimati.</p>
<p>"We will be celebrating 2026 on a beach with no satellites, no signs of human life, complete darkness and countless crabs," Bryant tells me.</p>
<p>"We are very happy to celebrate in tranquillity because we want this to be the theme of 2026."</p>
<p>In a few hours, Bryant will also be taking part in a community celebration, where a small group of locals will gather to watch the first sun rise of the new year.</p>
<p>"We will stand on the beach, a celebration that does lead to hope as the new year comes our way," he says.</p>

<p>We've just started our live coverage from the London newsroom, and 2026 still feels a little way off for us.</p>
<p>But in some parts of the world, celebrations are already in full swing as partygoers count down the final hours - or in some cases, minutes - until the new year.</p>
<p>The first nation to officially enter 2026 will be the Pacific islands of Kiribati. Midnight local time for the country's eastern Kiritimati atoll - also known as Christmas Island - falls at 10:00 GMT.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the clocks will chime in New Zealand, where midnight local time is 11:00 GMT. For most of Australia's east coast, it will be 13:00 GMT.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea will welcome the new year at 15:00 GMT, where bells are often rung to bring in the New Year. An hour later, it will be the turn of Hong Kong, Singapore and others.</p>
<p>Most of Europe brings in the New Year before the UK does. Countries such as Germany, France and Italy will have their new year at 23:00 GMT.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we're without company here in London. Most of Portugal, Ghana and Iceland also celebrate at 00:00 GMT, to name just a few.</p>
<p>And after us, it's the turn of the Americas - Rio de Janeiro in Brazil at 03:00 GMT, the US east coast at 05:00 GMT, and the US west coast at 08:00 GMT.</p>
<p>Last but not least is Baker Island, at 12:00 GMT tomorrow.</p>
