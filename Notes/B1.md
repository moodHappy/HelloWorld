Title: Drunk Raccoon Breaks into Liquor Store

A very drunk raccoon broke into a liquor store in Virginia on Saturday. The store staff were surprised to find the raccoon passed out in the bathroom. The raccoon had drunk some strong alcohol from the bottom shelf. An animal control officer took the raccoon to a safe place to sleep and get better. After a few hours, the raccoon was released back into the wild. The store had been closed for Thanksgiving, but the raccoon got in through the ceiling and drank a lot of alcohol. The officer said the raccoon had a "full-blown rampage" and drank everything. The store thanked the animal control team for helping the raccoon and giving it a "sober ride home". The officer said it was just a normal day for her.
