<p>Title: "Fighting Illegal Fishing in Italy's Mediterranean"</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean Sea near Italy, there is a big problem. Many fishermen are using illegal traps to catch fish. These traps are like big plastic boxes with nets that float in the water. They can hurt or kill many animals, including sharks, turtles, and dolphins.</p>
<p>A group called Sea Shepherd is trying to stop this. They have a boat that sails around the Mediterranean, looking for these illegal traps. When they find one, they use a special machine to pull it out of the water. Then, they throw the trap away and make sure it doesn't hurt any more animals.</p>
<p>The people on the boat are very careful. They don't want to get caught by the fishermen who use these illegal traps. They work with the police and other authorities to make sure the traps are removed and the fishermen are punished.</p>
<p>Sea Shepherd has already removed over 600 of these traps from the Mediterranean. They are also working with scientists to learn more about the problem and how to stop it. The group is making a map of all the places where they find these traps, so they can show the government where to focus their efforts.</p>
<p>The problem is big, but Sea Shepherd is helping. They are working hard to protect the animals and the ocean. They want to make sure the Mediterranean Sea is clean and safe for all the creatures that live there.</p>
