US President Donald Trump has signed a travel ban for citizens from 12 countries. The ban starts on June 9 and is meant to "protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors." Seven more countries face partial travel restrictions. 

Some people are exempt, including those who worked for the US military in Afghanistan, athletes, and diplomats. The ban is likely to face legal challenges, as did a similar ban in 2017.

The African Union has expressed concern over the ban, saying it may harm relations between Africa and the US. Many Afghans who helped US forces are also worried, as they are still waiting to be resettled in the US.
