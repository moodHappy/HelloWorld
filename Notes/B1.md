<p>Title: "US Military Parade and Anti-Trump Protests"</p>
<p>The US President, Donald Trump, is attending a big military parade in Washington DC. The parade is to celebrate 250 years of the US Army. Trump said America is the "hottest country in the world" and will be "greater and stronger than ever before." The event has almost 7,000 soldiers and includes flyovers and fireworks. However, many people are protesting against Trump's presidency in cities across the US. The protests are called "No Kings Day" and are the largest against Trump since he was re-elected. Some protesters are holding signs that say "Trump Must Go Now." The military parade is estimated to cost between $25m and $45m. Trump is also facing criticism for using the military in Los Angeles and for the cost of the parade. Despite the rain, thousands of people are attending the parade, but the crowd is smaller than expected. The atmosphere at the event is similar to a Trump campaign rally, with many people supporting the president.</p>
