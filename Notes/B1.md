<p>Doctors in England are using a new computer helper called AI. This AI looks at pictures of people's chests, called X-rays. It can find problems like lung sickness very quickly.</p>

<p>The AI works with doctors to help them see problems faster. This means sick people can get help sooner. The AI can find many different things wrong in the X-rays.</p>

<p>Doctors say the AI is like a helper, not a replacement. The doctors still make the big choices about what's wrong. They hope this new tool will make their work easier and help patients feel better faster.</p>
