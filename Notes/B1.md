I was walking home after a long day when I found a tiny shop I had never noticed. The window was full of bright toys and soft lights. In the front display, a pink Hello Kitty plush sat next to a red bow. It looked friendly. I smiled and walked in. The shopkeeper showed me the plush and said it was still new. I bought it, thinking it would bring me luck.

Back home, I kept it on the table and talked to it like a friend. 'Hello Kitty, what should I do about work tomorrow?' I asked, just to hear a small, comforting voice inside my head. The plush stayed quiet, but somehow I felt braver. I stacked my papers, cleaned the kitchen, and tried to sleep. In the morning, I found a new idea for a project at work.

That little plush kept becoming a tiny mentor. I did not expect a toy to help with real life, but it did. I walked into the office with a calmer smile and finished my tasks on time. After work, I came home and found Hello Kitty back on the table, waiting. It seemed to say, 'Well done.' Maybe the best friends are quiet helpers who cheer you along.
