<p>The United Nations (U.N.) says the world is in a birth rate crisis. The U.N. created a report called "State of World Population 2025". It highlights how fewer babies are being born. At the same time, people are living longer. This is creating problems. Fewer workers have to pay the pensions of more older people. The U.N. said: "Many countries are [having problems] with ageing and shrinking populations, labour shortages, and risingâ€¦pension costs."</p>

<p>The U.N. asked 14,000 people in 14 countries for its report. It found that having children is becoming too expensive. Couples want children, but cannot afford them. Couples cannot have the number of children they want. Reasons for this include low salaries, expensive houses, and worries about the future. One solution to this crisis is "family-friendly" policies, like cheaper childcare and paid holidays for carers.</p>
