Title: Nail Artist Hopes Movie Success Helps Her Craft

A nail artist named Shea Osei hopes her work on the movie "Wicked" will help make nail art more important in the entertainment industry.

Shea created the nails for actress Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in the film. Her designs became very popular and helped get attention for nail art.

The 34-year-old from Essex has been doing Cynthia's nails for 15 years. For the movie, she made over 35 different nail sets, with each taking up to 90 minutes to create.

Shea says the nails tell a story about Elphaba's character - they start short and get longer, with colors becoming more daring as the character grows more confident.

Before the movie, Shea felt nails were often an "afterthought" in the industry, not as important as hair or makeup. Now she hopes more people will see nails as an important part of storytelling in films.

Shea says her success shows that hard work pays off. She hopes to inspire other nail artists to believe they can achieve great things too.
