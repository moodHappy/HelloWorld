<p><strong>How to change your life â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>This video is for smart people who feel stuck. They want to do something, but they do not start.</p>
<p>People wait for the best time. They think too much but do nothing. They feel scared. They want to be perfect. They feel tired, but they believe they are just lazy. They wait and wait, but never start. This is a problem.</p>
<p>The video says that we must do something now. It can be a small thing. It can be a bad first try. But you move. That is good. That is how you grow.</p>
<p>Difficult words: stuck (when you cannot move), scared (worried), perfect (very good), tired (without energy).</p>
<p>You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.</p>
