<p><strong>中国开始建造世界上最大的水坝，引发印度担忧 --- China starts building world's largest dam, fuelling fears in India</strong></p>
<p>Chinese authorities have begun constructing what will be the world's largest hydropower dam in Tibetan territory, in a project that has sparked concerns from India and Bangladesh.
中国当局已开始在西藏领土上建造世界上最大的水电站，该项目引发了印度和孟加拉国的担忧。</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang presided over a ceremony marking the start of construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo river on Saturday, according to local media.
据当地媒体报道，中国国务院总理李强周六主持了雅鲁藏布江干流枢纽工程开工仪式。</p>
<p>The river flows through the Tibetan plateau. The project has attracted criticism for its potential impact on millions of Indians and Bangladeshis living downriver, as well as the surrounding environment and local Tibetans.
这条河流经青藏高原 。该项目因其对下游数百万印度和孟加拉国居民以及周边环境和当地藏族居民的潜在影响而受到批评。</p>
<p>Beijing says the scheme, costing an estimated 1.2tn yuan ($167bn; £125bn), will prioritise ecological protection and boost local prosperity.
北京表示，该计划预计耗资 1.2 万亿元人民币（1670 亿美元；1250 亿英镑），将优先保护生态环境并促进当地繁荣。</p>
<p>When completed, the project - also known as the Motuo Hydropower Station - will overtake the Three Gorges dam as the world's largest, and could generate three times more energy.
该项目（又名墨脱水电站）建成后将超越三峡大坝，成为世界最大水电站，发电量将是三倍。</p>
<p>Experts and officials have flagged concerns that the new dam would empower China to control or divert the trans-border Yarlung Tsangpo, which flows south into India's Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states as well as Bangladesh, where it feeds into the Siang, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers.
专家和官员担心，新大坝将使中国有权控制或转移跨境的雅鲁藏布江。雅鲁藏布江向南流入印度的阿鲁纳恰尔邦和阿萨姆邦以及孟加拉国，然后汇入桑河、布拉马普特拉河和亚穆纳河。</p>
<p>A 2020 report published by the Lowy Institute, an Australian-based think tank, noted that "control over these rivers [in the Tibetan Plateau] effectively gives China a chokehold on India's economy".
澳大利亚智库洛伊研究所 2020 年发布的一份报告指出，“对青藏高原这些河流的控制实际上使中国扼住了印度经济的咽喉”。</p>
<p>In an interview with news agency PTI earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu expressed concern that the Siang and Brahmaputra could "dry up considerably" once the dam was completed.
本月早些时候，阿鲁纳恰尔邦首席部长佩玛·坎杜在接受印度报业托拉斯（PTI）采访时表示，他担心一旦大坝建成，西昂河和雅鲁藏布江可能会“大幅干涸 ”。</p>
<p>He added that the dam was "going to cause an existential threat to our tribes and our livelihoods. It is quite serious because China could even use this as a sort of 'water bomb'".
他补充说，大坝“将对我们的部落和生计造成生存威胁。这非常严重，因为中国甚至可能把它当作一种‘水炸弹’”。</p>
<p>"Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed," he said. "In particular, the Adi tribe and similar groups... would see all their property, land, and especially human life, suffer devastating effects."
“假设大坝建成后，他们突然放水，我们整个锡安地带都会被摧毁，”他说。“尤其是阿迪部落和类似的族群……他们的所有财产、土地，尤其是人民的生命，都会遭受毁灭性的影响。”</p>
<p>In January a spokesperson for India's ministry of external affairs said they had expressed concerns to China about the impact of mega-dams and had urged Beijing to "ensure the interests of downstream states" were not harmed. They had also emphasised the "need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries".
今年 1 月，印度外交部发言人表示，他们已向中国表达了对大型水坝影响的担忧，并敦促北京“确保下游国家的利益”不受损害。他们还强调“需要保持透明度并与下游国家进行磋商 ”。</p>
<p>India plans to build a hydropower dam on the Siang river, which would act as a buffer against sudden water releases from China's dam and prevent flooding in their areas.
印度计划在西昂河上修建一座水电大坝，作为缓冲中国大坝突然泄水的屏障 ，防止该地区发生洪水 。</p>
<p>China's foreign ministry has previously responded to India, saying in 2020 that China has a "legitimate right" to dam the river and has considered downstream impacts.
中国外交部此前已于 2020 年对印度作出回应，称中国拥有在黄河上修建大坝的“ 合法权利”，并已考虑到对下游的影响。</p>
<p>Bangladesh also expressed concerns to China about the project, with officials in February sending a letter to Beijing requesting more information on the dam.
孟加拉国也向中国表达了对该项目问题的担忧，其官员于二月份致信北京，要求提供有关该大坝的更多信息。</p>
<p>Chinese authorities have long eyed the hydropower potential of the dam's location in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
中国当局长期以来一直关注西藏自治区大坝所在地的水电潜力。</p>
<p>It's in a massive canyon that is said to be the world's deepest and longest on land, along a section where the Yarlung Tsangpo - Tibet's longest river - makes a sharp U-turn around the Namcha Barwa mountain.
它位于一个巨大的峡谷中，据说是世界上陆地上最深、最长的峡谷，位于雅鲁藏布江（西藏最长的河流） 绕过南迦巴瓦峰的地段。</p>
<p>In the process of making this turn - which has been termed "the Great Bend" - the river drops hundreds of metres in its elevation.</p>
<p>Earlier reports indicated that authorities planned to drill multiple 20km-long tunnels through the Namcha Barwa mountain, via which they would divert part of the river.</p>
<p>Over the weekend a Xinhua report on Li Qiang's visit said that engineers would conduct "straightening" work and "divert water through tunnels" to build five cascading power stations.</p>
<p>Xinhua also reported that the hydropower dam's electricity would be mainly transmitted out of the region to be used elsewhere, while accommodating for Tibet's needs.</p>
<p>China has been eyeing the steep valleys and mighty rivers in the rural west - where Tibetan territories are located - to build mega-dams and hydropower stations that can sustain the country's electricity-hungry eastern metropolises. President Xi Jinping has personally pushed for this in a policy called "xidiandongsong", or "sending western electricity eastwards".</p>
<p>The Chinese government and state media have presented these dams as a win-win solution that cuts pollution and generates clean energy while uplifting rural Tibetans.</p>
<p>But activists say the dams are the latest example of Beijing's exploitation of Tibetans and their land - and past protests have been crushed.</p>
<p>Last year, the Chinese government rounded up hundreds of Tibetans who had been protesting against another hydropower dam. It ended in arrests and beatings, with some people seriously injured, the BBC learned through sources and verified footage.</p>
<p>There are also environmental concerns over the flooding of Tibetan valleys renowned for their biodiversity, and the possible dangers of building dams in a region rife with earthquake fault lines.</p>
<p>CORRECTION 21 July 2025: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the estimated cost of the dam was $1.67bn.</p>
