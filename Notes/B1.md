<p>Title: "Trump Gives Iran Two Weeks to Negotiate"</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has decided to wait two weeks before deciding whether to attack Iran. This decision has started a rush to restart talks between the US and Iran, which had stopped after Israel began bombing Iran last week.</p>
<p>Trump and his advisors hope that Iran will agree to terms it had previously rejected, such as stopping its uranium enrichment activities. The US has not pressured Israel to stop its attacks, and Trump has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "keep going."</p>
<p>European leaders, including those from Britain, Germany, and France, will meet with Iranian representatives in Geneva to discuss a possible deal. However, US officials do not have high expectations for the meeting's success.</p>
<p>Iran has consistently said it will not talk to the US until Israel stops its attacks. The US has not scheduled any official talks with Iran, and Trump's decision to wait two weeks may be a sign that he is open to a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>Trump has been discussing military options with his advisors, including the possibility of using bunker-buster bombs to destroy Iran's underground nuclear facility. However, he is worried about starting a long-term war and has said he wants to avoid taking action that could lead to a multi-year conflict.</p>
<p>The situation remains uncertain, with many US diplomats and European leaders seeking guidance on how to proceed. The US has maintained some communication with Iranian officials, and Trump's friend and foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been leading negotiations to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
