<p><strong>特朗普对付伊朗有哪些选择？ --- What are Trump's options for dealing with Iran?</strong></p>
<p>President Trump's comments on the Israel-Iran conflict have veered from full throated support for Israel's strikes to strongly distancing himself from them, and back again.
特朗普总统对以伊冲突的评论从全力支持以色列的袭击到强烈与以色列保持距离，然后又回到了原点。</p>
<p>His ambiguity has added to the sense of uncertainty as the fighting itself escalates.
随着战斗本身的升级，他的模棱两可的态度增加了不确定性。</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the attacks were "fully coordinated" with the US.
与此同时，以色列总理本雅明内塔尼亚胡表示，此次袭击是与美国“全面协调”的。</p>
<p>So what factors are weighing on Trump and, crucially, what are his options now?
那么，哪些因素对特朗普造成压力？最重要的是，他现在有哪些选择？</p>
<p>As Israeli missiles hit Tehran on Thursday, Trump threatened Iran's leaders with "even more brutal" attacks from his Israeli ally armed with American bombs.
周四，以色列导弹袭击德黑兰时，特朗普威胁伊朗领导人，他的以色列盟友将使用美国炸弹对伊朗发动“更加残酷”的袭击。</p>
<p>We know Trump's ultimate objective. He says, like Netanyahu, that Iran can't have a nuclear bomb. Crucially, he has said his preferred option (unlike Netanyahu) is via a deal between the US and Iran (this route also reflects his self-described image as a world-class dealmaker).
我们知道特朗普的最终目标。他和内塔尼亚胡一样，声称伊朗不可能拥有核弹。至关重要的是，他表示，他更倾向于通过美国和伊朗达成协议（这与内塔尼亚胡不同）（这条路线也体现了他自诩的世界级交易撮合者的形象 ）。</p>
<p>But he has equivocated over how to get there, sometimes leaning into the threat of force, other times pushing the diplomacy. Last week he even said in the same breath that an Israeli attack on Iran would help a deal or it would "blow it".
但他对如何达成协议含糊其辞，有时倾向于武力威胁，有时则推动外交途径。上周，他甚至还声称，以色列袭击伊朗将有助于达成协议，否则就会“毁了协议”。</p>
<p>His unpredictability is sometimes portrayed by his supporters after the fact as strategic - the so-called "madman" theory of foreign relations. This theory is one that has previously been used to describe Trump's negotiating tactics and suggests that deliberate uncertainty or unpredictability about escalation works to coerce adversaries (or even allies in Trump's case) into complying. It was famously attributed to some of the Cold War practices of President Richard Nixon.
事后，他的支持者有时会将他的不可预测性描绘成一种战略——即所谓的外交关系“ 疯子理论”。这一理论此前曾被用来描述特朗普的谈判策略，认为刻意制造升级的不确定性或不可预测性，能够迫使对手 （在特朗普的案例中甚至是盟友） 屈服 。这一理论曾被广泛地归因于理查德·尼克松总统的一些冷战做法。</p>
<p>Some of Trump's advisers and supporters back the "maximum pressure" side of the madman theory when it comes to his approach to Iran. They think the threats will in the end prevail because, they argue, Iran is not serious about negotiating (even though in 2015 the country signed an Obama-led nuclear deal that Trump later pulled out of).
在谈到特朗普对伊朗的态度时，他的一些顾问和支持者支持“ 疯子理论”中的“极限施压”立场。他们认为，这些威胁最终会占上风， 因为他们认为，伊朗对谈判并不认真（尽管伊朗在 2015 年签署了奥巴马主导的核协议，但特朗普后来退出了）。</p>
<p>Netanyahu has applied constant pressure on Trump to go down the military not diplomatic path, and the US president may in the end see a need to deliver on his more belligerent threats to Tehran's leadership.
内塔尼亚胡不断向特朗普施压，要求他采取军事而非外交手段，而美国总统最终可能会认为有必要对德黑兰领导层发出更为激烈的威胁。</p>
<p>Israel may also push harder behind the scenes for American involvement to, as it sees it, to finish the job. The US has bunker buster bombs Israel believes can destroy Iran's underground uranium enrichment site at Fordow.
以色列或许还会在幕后更加努力地争取美国的参与，因为它认为这有助于完成这项工作。以色列认为，美国拥有的掩体炸弹可以摧毁伊朗位于福尔多的地下铀浓缩设施 。</p>
<p>As the fighting escalates, so does the pressure on Trump from the hawkish camp of Republicans in Congress who have long called for regime change in Iran.
随着战斗升级，国会中共和党鹰派阵营对特朗普的压力也越来越大，他们长期以来一直呼吁伊朗政权更迭。</p>
<p>Trump will also see the argument that it could force the Iranians into negotiating with him with a now weaker hand. But the fact remains that the Iranians already were at that table, as a sixth round of talks due with Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff had been planned in Oman on Sunday.
特朗普也会认为，这可能会迫使伊朗人以更弱的姿态与他谈判。但事实是，伊朗人已经坐到了谈判桌前，因为原定于周日在阿曼与特朗普特使史蒂夫·维特科夫举行的第六轮会谈已安排妥当。</p>
<p>The talks are now abandoned.
谈判现已被放弃。</p>
<p>So far, Trump has reiterated that the US is not involved in Israel's attacks.
迄今为止，特朗普重申美国没有参与以色列的袭击。</p>
<p>Escalation comes with significant and potentially legacy-defining risks for Trump. American naval destroyers and ground based missile batteries are already helping in Israel's defence against the Iranian retaliation.
局势升级将给特朗普带来重大风险，甚至可能影响其政治遗产。美国海军驱逐舰和陆基导弹发射装置已在协助以色列抵御伊朗的报复性打击。</p>
<p>Some of Trump's advisers at the National Security Council are likely to be cautioning against him doing anything that could add to the intensity of Israel's attacks on Iran in the immediate days, especially with some Iranian missiles breaching Israeli-US defences to deadly effect.
特朗普在国家安全委员会的一些顾问可能会警告他不要采取任何可能加剧以色列在近期对伊朗袭击力度的行动，尤其是一些伊朗导弹突破了以色列-美国防御系统并造成致命影响。</p>
<p>Netanyahu is now arguing that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would end, not escalate, the conflict.
内塔尼亚胡现在认为，针对伊朗最高领袖阿里·哈梅内伊将会结束冲突，而不是使冲突升级。</p>
<p>But an anonymous US official briefed to some news outlets at the weekend that Trump made clear he was against such a move.</p>
<p>One of the big political factors playing on Trump's mind is his domestic support.</p>
<p>Most Republicans in Congress still staunchly back Israel, including continued American arms supplies to the country. Many have vocally backed Israel's attacks on Iran.</p>
<p>But there are key voices within Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) movement who now outright reject this traditional "ironclad" support for Israel.</p>
<p>Over the last few days they've asked why the US is risking being drawn into a Middle East war given Trump's "America First" foreign policy promise.</p>
<p>The pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson wrote a stinging criticism on Friday saying the administration's claims not to be involved weren't true, and that the US should "drop Israel".</p>
<p>He suggested Mr Netanyahu "and his war-hungry government" were acting in a way that would drag in US troops to fight on his behalf.</p>
<p>Carlson wrote: "Engaging in it would be a middle finger in the faces of the millions of voters who cast their ballots in hopes of creating a government that would finally put the United States first."</p>
<p>Similarly, the staunch Trump loyalist US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X that: "Anyone slobbering for the US to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA".</p>
<p>This represents a considerable vulnerability for Trump.</p>
<p>It adds pressure on him to put distance between the US and Israel's offensive and there are signs, in public at least, that he has responded.</p>
<p>The Maga debate over the weekend coincided with him posting on social media that he joined Russia's president Putin in calling for an end to the war. By Sunday he said Iran and Israel should make a deal, adding: "The US had nothing to do with the attack on Iran".</p>
<p>Iran has already threatened to attack US bases in the region if, as is now happening, Washington assists Israel's defence.</p>
<p>The risk of any American casualties would likely see the Maga isolationist argument grow exponentially, in turn potentially adding pressure on Trump to pull back and urge Mr Netanyahu to bring the offensive to a swifter end.</p>
