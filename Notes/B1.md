I was on this crazy train ride through the mountains and I saw the most breathtaking views. I was traveling with my friends, we had been planning this trip for ages. We decided to take the train instead of driving, it was way more fun. We met some really cool people on the train, like this old couple who were celebrating their anniversary. They told us about their travels, it was so inspiring. We stopped at this tiny village, the food was amazing, we tried all this local stuff. I was a bit worried about the language barrier, but everyone was so friendly. We took a hike around the village, the scenery was just stunning. I took loads of photos, but they don't do it justice. It was one of those trips that you never forget, I felt so alive and connected to nature.
