<p>Title: "Iranians Feel Unsafe After Israeli Attacks"</p>
<p>Many people in Iran feel scared and stuck after Israel attacked the country. The attacks started on Friday and have continued for several days. Israel has hit many places in Iran, including buildings where people live. At least 128 people have been killed in Iran, and 10 people have been killed in Israel.</p>
<p>People in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, are trying to leave the city to escape the attacks. However, it's hard for them to get out because of heavy traffic. Many people are also worried about their loved ones who can't leave the city.</p>
<p>The internet has been unstable, making it hard for people to communicate with each other. Some people have received warnings from the Israeli military to leave areas near military sites. However, people don't know where these sites are, so they don't know where to go.</p>
<p>The situation is very stressful and scary for many Iranians. Some people remember the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and are reminded of the bombings and shelters they experienced during that time. However, this time, there are no warnings or sirens before the attacks happen.</p>
<p>People in Iran just want to survive and keep their families safe. They don't want to be part of the conflict between Israel and Iran. They just want peace and safety.</p>
