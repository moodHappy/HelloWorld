<p><strong>EU countries bring back border checks â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>The Schengen Agreement is 40 years old. It helps people and goods go between countries in Europe. They do not stop at borders.</p>
<p>Now, some countries use border checks again. Germany is one of these countries. It wants to stop problems with people coming in. Some people say the checks are OK only for a short time. But some countries use them for a long time. This creates problems. Many people do not like the checks.</p>
<p>One professor says that many things in Schengen work. But the checks at the borders are not good. They make travel slow. People want easy travel in Europe. They do not want new stops at borders.</p>
<p>Difficult words: goods (things to buy and sell), border (the line between two countries), border check (when officials or police stop people on the border of a country).</p>
