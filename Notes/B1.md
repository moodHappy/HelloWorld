Title: US National Guard Member Dies After Shooting in Washington DC

A 20-year-old US National Guard member, Sarah Beckstrom, has died after being shot in Washington DC. She was one of two guardsmen shot near Farragut Square on Wednesday. The other guardsman, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, is still fighting for his life. The suspect, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal from Afghanistan, has been arrested. The shooting has led to announcements from the US government to curb migration from Afghanistan and other countries. The US president, Donald Trump, confirmed Beckstrom's death and said she was a "highly respected, young, magnificent person". The attack has raised concerns about national security and migration. The US government has suspended processing immigration requests from Afghans and will re-examine green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries.
