It was a dark and stormy night, and Detective Jameson was called to the old mansion. The owner, Mr. Smith, was found dead in his study. The detective started investigating and found a cryptic message on the desk: "The killer is someone you trust." Jameson began questioning the staff. There was Emma, the loyal housekeeper, who seemed shaken but cooperative. Then there was Thomas, the chef, who appeared nervous and fidgety. As Jameson continued his inquiry, he discovered a hidden safe behind a painting. Inside, he found a letter revealing that Mr. Smith had been blackmailing someone. The detective realized that the killer must have been someone with a dark secret. Suddenly, Emma's alibi didn't add up, and Thomas's nervousness made sense. But just as Jameson was about to accuse one of them, he received a call: "You're getting close, but you're wrong."
