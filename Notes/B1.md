I wake up every morning at 7 o'clock. After washing my face, I have breakfast with my family. We usually eat toast and scrambled eggs. Then, I go to work by bus. The journey takes about 30 minutes. At the office, I check my emails and start my tasks. I have lunch at a nearby restaurant with my colleagues. We often talk about our weekends. In the evening, I go to the gym to exercise. After that, I go home and have dinner with my family. We watch TV or play games together. At 10 o'clock, I go to bed and prepare for the next day. This is my daily routine, simple but comfortable. I like it because it helps me stay organized and focused.
