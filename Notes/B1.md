<p><strong>US mothers lose money and jobs – level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Mothers make less money than other people. This is called the “motherhood penalty.”</p>
<p>A study shows that mothers in the US make less than women with no kids and much less than men. Some mothers stop working because childcare costs too much. Others work less hours. They do not get money to save for later. Some mothers are afraid of the future. Their husbands have more money. Some moms feel sad or angry. They work hard but have to stop for their kids. Still, they say that they love their children very much. They just do not think being a mother will be this hard.</p>
<p>Difficult words: motherhood (when a woman is a mother), penalty (something what hurts you or makes you weak), kid (a child).</p>
