<p><strong>The EU-Mauritania fisheries deal â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Many boats go to the sea near Nouadhibou in Mauritania. Fishermen from different countries want to catch fish. Fish give food and money.</p>
<p>But it is not an easy job. The men stay on the sea for many days. Some fish are not easy to find now. People catch too many fish. Big ships and factories take fish for other things, too. Some factories try to help the sea, but some do not.</p>
<p>Mauritania and Europe work together. The EU gives money to build better fish markets. They build better places for boats. They want people to eat fish and have money. But they also want the sea to stay full of fish.</p>
<p>Difficult words: fisherman (a person who catches fish), market (a place to buy and sell things).</p>
