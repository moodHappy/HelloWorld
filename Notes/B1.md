I still remember that rainy day when I was a kid. I got wet on my way home from school. My mom was so angry, but then she made me hot chocolate and we sat by the window, watching the rain. She told me stories about her childhood, about playing in the rain and dancing in the puddles. I laughed so much that day. Now, whenever it rains, I think of my mom and those happy times. The smell of wet earth and the sound of raindrops on the roof bring back those memories. I feel like a kid again, carefree and happy. Rainy days are no longer just gloomy days, but a time to reminisce about the past and cherish the memories I made with my loved ones.
