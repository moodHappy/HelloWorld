<p><strong>特斯拉自动驾驶出租车服务在德克萨斯州低调推出 --- Tesla robotaxi service rolls out in 'low-key' Texas launch</strong></p>
<p>Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis rolled out for the first time on roads in Austin, Texas on Sunday.
特斯拉期待已久的自动驾驶出租车于周日首次在德克萨斯州奥斯汀的道路上推出。</p>
<p>In videos shared by Tesla on X, a small group of invited analysts, influencers and shareholders were shown participating in paid rides.
在特斯拉在 X 上分享的视频中，一小群受邀的分析师、有影响力的人士和股东参加了付费乘车活动。</p>
<p>The small number of vehicles deployed had a human safety operator in the passenger seat, according to reports.
据报道，部署的少数车辆在乘客座位上配备了一名人类安全操作员。</p>
<p>Analysts said the "low-key" robotaxi launch highlights Tesla's big bid to compete with existing self-driving taxi operators in the US and China, as the sector grows.
分析人士表示，随着自动驾驶出租车行业的不断发展，“低调”推出自动驾驶出租车凸显了特斯拉与美国和中国现有自动驾驶出租车运营商展开竞争的决心。</p>
<p>Musk congratulated Tesla's artificial intelligence and chip design teams on the launch in a post on X, writing that it was "culmination of a decade of hard work".
马斯克在 X 上的一篇帖子中对特斯拉人工智能和芯片设计团队的发布表示祝贺 ， 并写道这是“十年辛勤工作的成果 ”。</p>
<p>"Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla," he added.
他补充道：“人工智能芯片和软件团队都是特斯拉内部从零开始建立的 。”</p>
<p>Ahead of Sunday's pilot, he said in a jokey post that customers would pay "a $4.20 flat fee" for rides in Tesla robotaxis.
在周日的试点之前，他在一篇开玩笑的帖子中表示，乘客乘坐特斯拉自动驾驶出租车将支付 “ 4.20 美元的固定费用”。</p>
<p>The small fleet of vehicles do not yet include the Cybercab - the futuristic car concept unveiled by Musk at Tesla's "We, Robot" event in October - which Musk says will be the company's driverless taxi in the future.
目前，这支小型车队中还不包括 Cyber​​cab—— 这是马斯克在 10 月份特斯拉“我们，机器人”活动上发布的未来汽车概念 ——马斯克表示，这将是该公司未来的无人驾驶出租车。</p>
<p>Instead it was existing Tesla vehicles, with a small "robotaxi" logo on the side, that took to Austin streets on Sunday.
相反，周日在奥斯汀街头行驶的是现有的特斯拉汽车，车身侧面带有一个小小的“机器人出租车”标志。</p>
<p>Forrester analyst Paul Miller described the launch of the pilot as a "low-key affair".
Forrester 分析师保罗· 米勒 ( Paul Miller) 称此次试点的启动是一次“低调的事件”。</p>
<p>"As expected, only a handful of vehicles are available right now, they only operate in a small part of the city and there's a safety driver in the vehicle in case it encounters situations it cannot handle autonomously," he said.
他说：“正如预期的那样，目前只有少数车辆可用，它们只在城市的一小部分地区运营 ，车内还有一名安全驾驶员，以防遇到无法自主处理的情况。”</p>
<p>But he added that the move highlighted the company's ambitions to rival firms already offering driverless ride-hailing in the US and around the world.
但他补充说，此举凸显了该公司与已经在美国和世界各地提供无人驾驶叫车服务的公司竞争的雄心。</p>
<p>Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet, along with Amazon's Zoox, already offer self-driving taxi rides in Austin, as well as in San Francisco, California, and Phoenix, Arizona.
谷歌母公司 Alphabet 旗下的 Waymo 和亚马逊的 Zoox 已经在奥斯汀、加利福尼亚州旧金山和亚利桑那州凤凰城提供自动驾驶出租车服务。</p>
<p>Meanwhile Uber, which recently announced it would bring forward trials of driverless taxis in the UK, has partnered with Chinese firms Pony.AI, WeRide and Momenta to bring autonomous ride-hailing to more cities outside the US and China.
与此同时，Uber 最近宣布将在英国提前试运行无人驾驶出租车 ，并已与中国公司小马智行、文远知行和 Momenta 合作，将自动驾驶叫车服务推广到美国和中国以外的更多城市。</p>
<p>Mr Miller said Tesla is betting that the volume of cars it delivers, data it has from vehicles and cheaper, camera-based self-driving tech "will allow it to come from behind and pull ahead" of rivals.
米勒表示，特斯拉押注其交付的汽车数量、从车辆获取的数据以及更便宜的基于摄像头的自动驾驶技术“将使其后来居上并超越”竞争对手。</p>
<p>But he added that its ability to compete, particularly with Chinese firms dominating the sector, will depend on improvement of its advanced assisted driving system - which Tesla calls Full Self-Driving (FSD).
但他补充说，特斯拉的竞争能力，尤其是在中国企业占据该领域主导地位的情况下，将取决于其先进辅助驾驶系统的改进——特斯拉称之为全自动驾驶 (FSD)。</p>
<p>FSD has been subject to probes by US auto regulators and complaints from customers about its safety.
FSD 一直受到美国汽车监管机构的调查，并且受到客户对其安全性的投诉。</p>
<p>"If that FSD system isn't a big leap forward from the driver assistance tech that buyers of regular Teslas already use in some countries, it's going to need a lot of remote monitoring and control from an army of teleoperating safety drivers," Mr Miller said.
米勒表示：“如果 FSD 系统与某些国家普通特斯拉汽车买家已经在使用的驾驶辅助技术相比没有太大的飞跃，那么它将需要大量远程操作安全驾驶员进行远程监控和控制。”</p>
<p>"This will add to Tesla's costs, and offer plenty of opportunities for embarrassing videos of Tesla robotaxis doing weird things."</p>
<p>It comes as a number of operators eye the growing market for driverless taxis.</p>
<p>German car maker Volkswagen believes it could swell to €450bn in size by 2035, according to a recent report by Fortune magazine.</p>
<p>But the rise of self-driving cars and ride-hailing services on US roads has also been met with some scepticism over their safety.</p>
<p>Tesla said in a post on its X account on Monday that its robotaxi service "will greatly increase safety for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians &amp; cyclists".</p>
<p>The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is reportedly reviewing information from Tesla regarding the safety of its self-driving taxis in bad weather, following a request in May.</p>
<p>General Motors pulled the plug on its Cruise robotaxi project in December after accidents involving its self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>The company also cited the increasingly competitive market as a reason for suspending its ride-hailing initiative.</p>
