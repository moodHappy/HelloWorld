<p>US National Guard deployment has been ordered by Donald Trump to Los Angeles in response to clashes over immigration raids. The National Guard will arrive within 24 hours, according to a federal official, to "regain order" in the area. This decision has been met with criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who describes it as "purposefully inflammatory" and claims that the Trump administration is seeking to "sow chaos" and escalate tensions.</p>
<p>The clashes began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carried out raids in the Los Angeles area, resulting in the arrest of as many as 118 people. Residents of a predominantly Latino district have been protesting against the raids, leading to confrontations with ICE federal agents and local law enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department has issued dispersal orders and used less lethal munitions to disperse crowds, while US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned that active duty Marines will be mobilized if violence continues.</p>
<p>The National Guard* is a reserve force that usually operates at the state level, but can be federalized by the president under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Trump has previously deployed the National Guard to deal with civil unrest, including in response to protests over the death of George Floyd* in 2020.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has been criticized for its immigration policies, including the use of ICE raids to detain and deport undocumented migrants*.</p>
<p>The situation in Los Angeles* remains tense, with protests and clashes continuing between demonstrators and law enforcement.</p>
<p>The deployment of the National Guard has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on community relations. Governor Newsom and other Democratic leaders have urged calm and called on the Trump administration to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement. The situation is being closely monitored, with updates expected as the situation develops.</p>
