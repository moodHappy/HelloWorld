<p><strong>Croatia costs too much for tourists â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Croatia is not cheap now. It is more expensive than before. A lady named Gracia has a small place. She gives food to people. She does not want to make meals cost more. But it is hard to find workers.</p>
<p>People do not stay long in one place anymore. They go to many places. Most people come from Germany, Austria, and Slovenia. Some people say that prices are high. But they also say that things are better now.</p>
<p>The tourist group says Croatia is still good. But people in Croatia are not happy. They may not have money to go to the beach. The most important thing is to help people and give good service.</p>
<p>Difficult words: expensive (when something costs a lot of money), service (the help of work that people give to tourists in hotels, restaurants, or shops).</p>
