<p>wuhuu!!!</p>
<p>holiday trip officially starting and my heart is already smiling </p>

<p>aaand it already started with chaos </p>
<p>security check decided I was very suspicious apparently… got checked and then the lady accidentally tickled my armpits and I legit squeaked  like a startled mouse. Everyone stared. I pretended this happens to me all the time. It does not.</p>

<p>now heading to the gate, still laughing at myself, cheeks red, dignity slightly left behind at airport security </p>

<p>so excited for warmer air, fresh fruit, slow mornings and just feeling light again </p>
<p>wishing everyone the sweetest, coziest, happiest holidays ever </p>

<p>laugh a lot, rest a little, and please… survive airport security with more grace than I did</p>
