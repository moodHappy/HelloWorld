<p>Tesla's shares have fallen by 14% after a disagreement between Elon Musk, the company's boss, and US President Donald Trump. This has caused Tesla to lose around $150 billion in market value.</p>
<p>The argument started when Musk criticized a spending bill that Trump supports. Musk thinks the bill will increase the government's debt too much. Trump responded by saying that Musk is unhappy because the government stopped giving tax credits for electric vehicles, which has helped Tesla's sales.</p>
<p>The disagreement has made investors worried about what might happen to Tesla's business. Some people think that the government might make it harder for Tesla to operate. This is because Trump has threatened to stop giving government contracts to Musk's companies, including SpaceX.</p>
<p>Musk and Trump have been arguing on social media, and their conversation has become very personal. Musk even told Trump to "go ahead, make my day" when Trump threatened to cut off government contracts.</p>
<p>Investors are watching the situation closely and are worried about what might happen next. Some people think that Musk should focus more on running Tesla and less on politics.</p>
