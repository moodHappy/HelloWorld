<p><strong>Beach Resorts - ESL Lesson Plan - Breaking News English Lesson</strong></p>
<p>North Korea will open a beach resort on Tuesday to provide a boost to its tourism industry. The Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is on the east coast. Its gleaming new hotels can accommodate 20,000 guests. State media reported that the flagship resort is the first of many developments planned throughout the country. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un cut the ribbon at a lavish opening ceremony. He called the new destination "the proud first step" toward fulfilling the nation's policy of expanding its travel sector. He added that the resort would "play a leading role in establishing the tourist culture" of North Korea. He also said it was one of the country's "greatest feats" of the year.

This new destination is North Korea's latest site for holidaymakers. It will initially cater to the domestic market, but officials say it will welcome foreign visitors. The Korean Central News Agency reported that Russian tours will start in late July. A state official stated that there could be an influx of Chinese tourists. "We are monitoring the potential resumption of large-scale Chinese group tours to North Korea, but no concrete signs have emerged yet." Chinese travellers constituted more than 90 per cent of visitors before the coronavirus pandemic. North Korea hasn't fully lifted a ban on foreign visitors that it imposed during COVID-19. It remains unclear when other international guests will be able to visit.</p>
