As she sat in the small café, Céline clutched her daughter's hand tightly, trying to push away the fears that had been lurking in her mind for months. The doctor's words still echoed in her ears: "Your daughter has the mutation, a 90% chance of developing cancer." The weight of those words felt like a crushing boulder, one that threatened to destroy the life they had built together.

Céline's eyes wandered to the other families in the café, laughter and chatter filling the air. She wondered if they knew, if they felt the same fear that gripped her heart. Her daughter, with her bright smile and sparkling eyes, was a ray of sunshine in a world that suddenly seemed dark and uncertain.

The donor's sperm, a gift given in good faith, had become a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury on their lives. Céline felt a mix of emotions: anger, sadness, and a deep sense of betrayal. How could this have happened? Why had they not been warned?

As she looked at her daughter, Céline knew she would do everything in her power to protect her, to fight the cancer that loomed over them like a specter. They would face it together, as a team, and they would emerge stronger, no matter what the future held.

But for now, in this moment, Céline just held her daughter's hand, trying to cherish the time they had, and praying that the darkness that threatened to consume them would not prevail.
