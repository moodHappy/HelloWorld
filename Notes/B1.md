US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are having a big argument. Last week, Musk left his job helping the government and criticized Trump's spending plan. Trump said he was disappointed in Musk, and Musk responded with strong attacks on social media. He even suggested that Trump might be connected to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but he didn't provide any evidence.

Trump fought back, saying Musk "went crazy" and threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies. The argument is happening on two different social media platforms: Trump is using Truth Social, and Musk is using X.

This public fight is affecting the stock market. Tesla's stock price dropped 14%, which is a big loss for Musk's electric car company.

Some people think that Musk's argument with Trump might actually help the Tesla brand in the long run. However, it's not clear if it will hurt Musk's personal image.

The White House has responded to Musk's allegations, saying they are "unfortunate" and that Trump is focused on passing his spending plan. The FBI has also said they have no comment on Musk's claims about Epstein.

This is a big story, and it's still developing. We'll have to wait and see what happens next in the argument between Trump and Musk.
