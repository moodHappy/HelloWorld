As the sun set over the quiet streets of Salisbury, a chill ran down the spine of the city's residents. It had been years since the fateful day when Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok, a deadly nerve agent. The incident had sent shockwaves through the community, and the memory of it still lingered like an open wound.

In a small flat on the outskirts of the city, a young woman named Emma sat on her couch, staring blankly at the TV as the news report about the Skripal poisoning inquiry played in the background. She had been a friend of Dawn Sturgess, the woman who had tragically died after coming into contact with the same nerve agent.

As Emma listened to the report, she couldn't help but think about the what-ifs. What if the authorities had acted faster? What if Dawn had been warned about the dangers of picking up discarded items? The questions swirled in her mind like a vortex, leaving her with a sense of frustration and sadness.

Just then, Emma's phone buzzed with a text from her friend, Sarah. "Hey, have you seen the news about the Skripal inquiry?" it read. Emma typed out a quick response, and the two friends began to discuss the report and its findings.

As they texted back and forth, Emma couldn't shake off the feeling that the poisoning had left a lasting impact on the city and its residents. It was as if the incident had created a sense of unease, a feeling that the streets of Salisbury were no longer safe.

But even in the midst of all this uncertainty, Emma found solace in the fact that the truth was finally coming to light. The inquiry's findings, though painful, were a reminder that justice would be served, and that those responsible for the poisoning would be held accountable.

As the night drew to a close, Emma turned off the TV and looked out the window, her gaze falling on the quiet streets of Salisbury. The city might never be the same again, but it would heal, and its residents would find a way to move forward, together.
