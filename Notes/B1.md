<p>Title: "A 47-Year-Old Mystery Solved: The North Sea Message in a Bottle"</p>
<p>A message in a bottle was found on a Swedish island after 47 years. The letter was written by Gavin Geddes, a crewmate of fisherman James Addison Runcie, who worked on the Loraley fishing boat. The letter was thrown into the sea in 1978 and was recently discovered by two friends, Ellinor and Asa, on the west coast of Sweden.</p>
<p>The letter was hard to read because it was wet and faded, but the friends were able to make out the name "Addison Runcie" and an address in Cullen, Banffshire, Scotland. After some research, it was found that James Addison Runcie had lived at that address and had died in 1995.</p>
<p>Gavin Geddes, who wrote the letter, was surprised to hear that it had been found after 47 years. He remembered writing the letter and throwing it into the sea with his crewmates. James Runcie's sister, Sandra Taylor, was also amazed by the story and said that her brother would have been happy to know that the letter had been found.</p>
<p>The discovery of the message in a bottle has connected people in Scotland and Sweden, and it has brought back memories of the past for those involved. Ellinor and Asa, who found the letter, are thrilled to have been a part of this amazing story and hope to visit Cullen one day to learn more about the history behind the letter.</p>
