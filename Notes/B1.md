<p>Title: "Protests in Los Angeles Over Immigration Raids"</p>
<p>Protests in Los Angeles have calmed down after three days. The protests were against immigration raids by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The protests were mainly in downtown LA. A British photographer was hurt by a sponge bullet, and an Australian reporter was hit by a non-lethal round.</p>
<p>The US President, Donald Trump, sent 2,000 National Guard troops to LA to stop the protests. California's Governor, Gavin Newsom, did not want the National Guard to come, but Trump did it anyway. Trump wants to tackle undocumented migrants in the US and has made it a priority.</p>
<p>The ICE agency has been doing more raids, and the goal is to arrest 3,000 people a day. The protests started after ICE officers did raids in LA, and people were arrested. Some people were detained at a federal building in downtown LA, which became a focus of the protests.</p>
<p>The situation is complex, with some people supporting Trump's actions and others opposing them. The Mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said that Trump's actions were causing chaos. The protests were mostly peaceful, but there were some violent incidents, and some people were arrested.</p>
<p>The city of Glendale in California has stopped working with ICE, saying it was a divisive issue. The protests have shown that people are concerned about immigration and want to defend their communities.</p>
