<p>Title: "The Meaning of the Juneteenth Flag"</p>
<p>The Juneteenth flag is a special symbol of the Juneteenth holiday in the United States. Juneteenth is a celebration of the day when the last group of enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom on June 19, 1865. The flag has a red top half and a blue bottom half, with a white star in the middle. The colors and design of the flag have important meanings.</p>
<p>The red and blue colors are like the colors of the American flag, which shows that enslaved Black people and their descendants are also Americans. The white star in the middle of the flag represents the state of Texas, where the last enslaved people were freed, and also represents the freedom of Black Americans in all 50 states.</p>
<p>The shape of the flag, with an arc between the red and blue parts, is meant to look like a horizon, symbolizing a hopeful future for Black Americans. The starburst around the white star represents a new beginning.</p>
<p>The Juneteenth flag was designed in 1997 by Ben Haith, the founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. It was later changed by artist Lisa Jeanne Graf, and the date "June 19, 1865" was added to the flag in 2007.</p>
<p>Today, the Juneteenth flag is an important part of the holiday celebrations, and flag-raising ceremonies are held in many places. The flag is a reminder of the long history of slavery and racism in the United States, and it symbolizes the freedom and equality that Black Americans have fought for.</p>
