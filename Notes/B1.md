<p>Title: "Israel and Iran Conflict"</p>
<p>There is a big fight between Israel and Iran. Iran launched many missiles at Israel, and Israel is fighting back. Four people in Israel were killed, and many more were hurt. The fight started when Israel attacked Iran on Friday. Iran says that 224 people have been killed in Israel's attacks.</p>
<p>The US President, Donald Trump, wants Israel and Iran to make a deal, but Iran says it won't talk about a ceasefire while it's being attacked. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says the problem is not just about stopping the fight, but also about stopping Iran from making nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Many people are hurt, and buildings are damaged. The fighting is very bad, and many countries are watching to see what happens next. The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, says that Iran should not have nuclear weapons, and Israel has the right to defend itself. The fight is getting worse, and it's not clear when it will stop.</p>
