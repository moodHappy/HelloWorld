<p><strong>Young people and cancer â€“ level 1 - News in Levels</strong></p>
<p>Bowel cancer is more usual in older people. But it is growing in younger adults under 50.</p>
<p>In England, cases are going up by 3.6% every year. Experts think that this happens because of bad food, being overweight, and not moving enough. They are still studying why this is happening. Better testing and genetics can be part of the problem, too.</p>
<p>If you feel unwell, it is good to see a doctor early. You may feel different when you go to the toilet. You may get slim without trying. You may be very tired. If doctors catch cancer early, they can help you stop it.</p>
<p>Difficult words: bowel (the long tube through which food travels from the stomach out of the body), case (when something happens), overweight (fat).</p>
