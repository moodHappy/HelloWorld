US President Donald Trump has introduced a travel ban affecting 12 countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East. The countries are: Afghanistan, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. 

The reasons for the ban include national security concerns, alleged breaking of US visa rules, and the countries' inability to issue secure passports. Some countries are also accused of supporting terrorism or having high visa overstay rates.

Seven other countries face partial restrictions: Venezuela, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Turkmenistan. The ban will start on Monday.
