# Marriage/Family

They married young. Two strangers becoming one. Three children followed. Laughter filled their small home. Work stressed them. Bills worried them. Yet every evening, they gathered at the table. Simple meals became sacred rituals. Weekends were park visits and board games. Arguments came and went, like passing storms. Through years grayed by time, their bond deepened. Children grew and left. The house grew quiet. But they found comfort in each other's presence. Marriage wasn't always easy, but family was everything. Together, they built a life worth living.
