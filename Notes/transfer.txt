Grandpa's old leather shoes sat by the door, worn but polished. Every Sunday, he'd put them on for our family dinner. "These shoes have walked more miles than you've lived, kiddo," he'd say with a wink. After he passed, I couldn't bear to part with them. Last week, I tried them on. They were big, but I could feel his presence. Now I wear them whenever I need courage. They're not just shoes anymore; they're a piece of my grandpa, reminding me to walk through life with the same dignity he did.
