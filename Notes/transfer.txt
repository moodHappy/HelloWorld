# The Cage

"You ever feel like you're trapped in a cage?" Mark asked Sarah while sipping his coffee.

"Every single day," she sighed. "This job, this apartment... everything just feels like walls closing in."

"I know what you mean," Mark replied. "I stare out my window every morning and wonder if today's the day I'll break free."

"How though? We've got bills, responsibilities... it's not like we can just fly away."

"We can find a way," Mark insisted. "Maybe not tomorrow, but someday. We deserve to be happy, not just survive."

Sarah smiled for the first time all week. "You know what? You're right. It's time to start planning our escape."
