Chapter 69: The Drive to Freedom

第六十九章：通往自由的车程

Inside the back of the Maybach, the silence was heavy.

迈巴赫的后座里，沉默很沉重。

Chen Mo drove. The partition was down.

陈默在开车。隔板降下了。

Miyetsuko sat in the back. She pulled the black veil off her head and threw it on the floor. She kicked off her heels.

美悦子坐在后面。她扯下头上的黑色面纱，扔在地板上。踢掉了高跟鞋。

She looked at her reflection in the rearview mirror. For the first time in seven years, she didn't see a victim. She didn't see a wife. She saw herself.

她看着后视镜里的倒影。七年来第一次，她没看到受害者。没看到妻子。她看到了她自己。

"Chen," she said softly.

“陈，”她轻声唤道。

"I'm here."

“我在。”

"Pull over."

“停车。”

"Here? It's the highway."

“这儿？这是高速公路。”

"Pull over."

“停车。”

Chen Mo pulled the car onto the shoulder of the rain-slicked highway, overlooking the Tokyo Tower.

陈默把车停在雨水湿滑的高速公路路肩上，俯瞰着东京塔。

He turned around.

他转过身。

Miyetsuko climbed over the center console into the front seat. She straddled him, right there in the driver's seat, the rain pounding on the roof.

美悦子爬过中控台，钻进前座。她跨坐在他身上，就在驾驶座上，大雨敲打着车顶。

She grabbed his face and kissed him. It was a desperate, hungry kiss. She tasted of tears she hadn't shed and freedom she hadn't tasted.

她捧住他的脸吻他。那是一个绝望、饥渴的吻。她尝起来有未流的泪水和未曾尝过的自由。

"He's gone, Chen. He's really gone," she sobbed into his neck, her body shaking.

“他没了，陈。他真的没了，”她在他脖颈处啜泣，身体颤抖。

"He's gone," Chen Mo held her tight, stroking her hair. "You are free."

“他没了，”陈默紧紧抱着她，抚摸着她的头发。“你自由了。”

She pulled back, her eyes red but shining. She reached for the ruby choker on her neck—the one Chen Mo gave her on the plane.

她退后一点，眼睛红了但闪着光。她伸手摸向脖子上的红宝石项圈——那是陈默在飞机上给她的。

"This isn't a leash anymore," she touched the gem. "It's a trophy."

“这不再是狗链了，”她摸着宝石。“这是战利品。”

"And what do you want to do with your freedom, Queen?" Chen Mo wiped a tear from her cheek.

“那你打算用你的自由做什么，女王？”陈默擦掉她脸颊上的一滴泪。

She looked out the window at the Tokyo Tower, glowing red in the mist. Then she looked at the Mishima Heavy Industries building in the distance—a black obelisk piercing the sky.

她看向窗外的东京塔，在雾中发出红光。然后她看向远处的三岛重工大楼——一座刺破天空的黑色方尖碑。

She smiled. The tears stopped. The predator returned.

她笑了。眼泪停了。掠食者回来了。

"I want it all, Chen."

“我全都要，陈。”

"I want to burn Mishima down. I want to build my own empire on his ashes. And I want you standing right next to me when I do it."

“我要烧了三岛。我要在他的灰烬上建立我自己的帝国。而我要你站在我身边，看着我做这一切。”

Chen Mo smirked. He started the engine. The V12 roared to life.

陈默坏笑了一下。发动引擎。V12引擎咆哮着苏醒。

"Your wish is my command."

“如你所愿。”
