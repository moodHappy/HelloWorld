How lazy can a person be? Last month, I bought a fancy electric toothbrush that promised to revolutionize my dental routine. For the first week, I enjoyed its vibrating bristles and timed cleaning cycles. Then one morning, it wouldn't turn on. The battery was dead. Instead of placing it on the charger, I just began using it like a regular toothbrush. Day after day, I walked past the charger, thinking "I'll do it later." A month passed before I finally plugged it in. My laziness had turned a high-tech gadget into an overpriced manual brush.
