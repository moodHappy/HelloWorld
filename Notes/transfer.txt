Chapter 9: Kurosaki's Agony

第九章：黑崎的痛苦

Part 1: The Ash of a Dynasty

皇朝的灰烬

The Kurosaki memorial hall was a tomb of silence. Soichiro Kurosaki stood before the altar, his face a mask of cracked stone. The incense smoke curled around the portrait of his son—a young man who was now nothing more than a headline and a memory.

黑崎家的灵堂是一座沉默的坟墓。黑崎宗一郎站在祭坛前，脸色如同一张开裂的石质面具。香烟绕着儿子的遗像盘旋——那个年轻人现在只不过是一条新闻标题和一段回忆。

He didn't cry. Men like Soichiro had long ago replaced their tear ducts with ice and ambition. But inside his chest, there was a hollow ache, a structural failure of his own legacy. He hadn't just lost a son; he had lost thirty years of grooming and a billion-dollar future.

他没有哭。像宗一郎这样的人，早就用冰冷和野心取代了泪腺。但在他的胸腔里，有一种空洞的隐痛，那是他自身基业的一种结构性坍塌。他失去的不只是一个儿子，而是三十年的培养和价值百亿的未来。

Everything he had built was meant to be passed on. Now, the line had ended against a concrete pillar in a spray of gasoline and fire.

他所建立的一切本该传承下去。而现在，这血脉在一根混凝土柱子前，在汽油与烈火的喷溅中，戛然而止。

Part 2: The Weight of Silence

沉默的重量

His assistants stood at the door, trembling. They brought reports of grieving relatives and funeral arrangements, but Soichiro ignored them. He stared at the red Lamborghini’s wreckage in the police report, the metal twisted into shapes that defied logic.

助手们战战兢兢地站在门口。他们带来了亲属哀悼和葬礼安排的报告，但宗一郎理都不理。他盯着警方报告里那辆红色兰博基尼的残骸，金属扭曲成了违背逻辑的形状。

"He was weak," Soichiro whispered to the empty room. His voice was a dry rasp. "A strong man controls his car. A strong man stays alive to inherit the world."

“他太弱了，”宗一郎对着空荡荡的房间低声说，声音干涩沙哑。“强者控制他的车，强者活下去以继承世界。”

But the harsh words couldn't fill the void. He felt a sudden, violent urge to crush something. If he couldn't have his heir, the world around him had to pay for the vacancy. The pain wasn't soft; it was a sharp, jagged edge that cut into his every thought.

但刻薄的话语无法填补空虚。他突然产生一种强烈的、暴力的冲动，想要捏碎点什么。如果他失去了继承人，他周围的世界就必须为这个空缺付出代价。这种痛苦并不柔软，而是一种锋利、锯齿状的边缘，割入他的每一个念头。

Part 3: The Redirection of Hunger

饥饿的转向

He picked up a file from the side table. It was the Lin family dossier. The "Last Line of Defense," Miyetsuko, was still out there, untouched and unaware. Originally, she was supposed to be a prize for his son. Now, she was just an asset in a failing empire.

他从侧桌拿起一份文件。那是林家的档案。“最后的防线”美悦子还在外面，未被触碰，也一无所知。原本，她该是他儿子的战利品。现在，她只是一个摇摇欲坠帝国里的资产。

His grief mutated into a cold, predatory hunger. The Lin family had lost their usefulness as in-laws, but they had gained a new status: prey. He would not let the Lins survive the death of his son. He would consume them entirely to fill the hole in his own house.

他的哀恸变异成了一种阴冷、掠食者般的饥渴。林家失去了作为姻亲的利用价值，却获得了一个新身份：猎物。他不会让林家在他儿子的死讯中幸存。他要彻底吞噬他们，以填补自己家中的空洞。

"Call the auditors," Soichiro commanded, not turning away from the altar. "Tell them to stop being gentle. I want the Lins on their knees by the end of the month. No more pauses."

“叫审计员来，”宗一郎命令道，没有从祭坛前转过身。“告诉他们别再温柔了。我要林家在月底前跪下。不再有任何停顿。”

Part 4: The Bitter Taste

苦涩的滋味

He reached out and touched the frame of the portrait. The glass was cold. It reminded him of the way Saori looked at him—blank, yielding, and ultimately unsatisfying. Even the best sex in the city couldn't wash away the taste of ash in his mouth.

他伸手碰了碰遗像的相框。玻璃很冰冷。这让他想起沙织看他的样子——空洞、顺从，最终索然无味。即使是这座城市里最顶级的性爱，也无法洗掉他口中那股烟灰的味道。

His son was dead, and the world was still turning. That was the ultimate insult. He would make sure that for the Lin family, the world stopped turning too.

他的儿子死了，而世界仍在转动。这是终极的羞辱。他要确保对林家而言，世界也会停止转动。
