好嘞！这次我写一篇更黑暗反转、很有《黑镜》味道的微小说：

Title: The Test

Jason volunteered for a new VR experiment. The scientist explained:
"It’s simple—you’ll experience ten minutes in a simulated world. When the timer ends, you’ll wake up here, safe."

Jason nodded, put on the headset, and opened his eyes in a sunny suburban street. Children laughed, birds sang, life felt warm and real. He lived, worked, even fell in love—all in what felt like decades.

One day, while holding his granddaughter’s hand, the world froze. A voice echoed:
"Ten minutes are over. Thank you for participating."

Jason ripped off the headset, gasping—only to see the same lab, the same scientist.

But when he tried to move, he couldn’t. His body was old, frail.
In the mirror, he saw himself: gray hair, wrinkled skin.

The “ten minutes” had never ended.

要不要我给你写一篇 只有几十个词 的极短篇（flash fiction），像《黑镜》广告短片那样，读完瞬间脊背发凉的？
