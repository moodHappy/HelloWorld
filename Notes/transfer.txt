The Adult Ceremony

成人礼

The hall smelled faintly of incense and polished wood. People whispered behind their hands, their voices trembling with anticipation. Lena adjusted the hem of her dress, feeling the smooth fabric brush against her fingers.

大厅里隐约弥漫着檀香和抛光木材的气味。人们捂着嘴轻声交谈，声音带着微微的颤抖。莉娜整理了一下裙摆，光滑的布料从指尖滑过。

A man stepped forward, holding a folded parchment. His eyes scanned the room, settling briefly on each face. Lena caught the slight furrow in his brow. The ceremony was about to begin.

一名男子走上前，手里握着折叠好的羊皮纸。他的目光扫过整个大厅，短暂停留在每张脸上。莉娜注意到他眉头微微蹙起。仪式即将开始。

The first candle was lit, and its flame danced across the walls. Each participant moved forward in turn, receiving a mark on the hand—a symbol of passage, a token of recognition. Lena’s hand trembled slightly as the brush touched her skin.

第一支蜡烛被点燃，火焰在墙壁上跳动。每位参与者依次走上前，手上被涂上印记——成人的象征，身份的认可。莉娜的手微微颤抖，当刷子碰到她的皮肤时。

Voices recited words she did not fully understand, but the rhythm sank into her chest. It felt like stepping into a space both ancient and personal. She closed her eyes, breathing slowly, letting the moment settle.

人们低声吟诵着她不完全理解的词句，但节奏渗入她的胸膛。仿佛踏入了一个既古老又私密的空间。她闭上眼睛，缓缓呼吸，让这一刻沉淀下来。

When the final candle flickered out, a silence fell. Lena looked around—faces glowing in the dim light, a mixture of pride and nervousness. She realized she had crossed a threshold, small yet irrevocable.

当最后一支蜡烛熄灭时，寂静降临。莉娜环顾四周——昏暗灯光下的面孔闪着光芒，混合着骄傲与紧张。她意识到自己已跨过一道门槛，虽小却不可逆。

The ceremony ended not with applause, but with quiet acknowledgment. Lena stepped back, feeling the weight and the freedom of being seen as an adult.

仪式并没有以掌声结束，而是以默默的认同收尾。莉娜退后一步，感受到作为成人被看见的重量与自由。
