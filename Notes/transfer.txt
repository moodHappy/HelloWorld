Grandpa's old radio sat on the dusty shelf, its wooden case scratched. "C'mere, kiddo," he'd say, fiddling with the dials. Static filled the room, then suddenly â€“ music! Old songs, crackly news reports, baseball games. We'd sit close, me cross-legged on the floor, him in his creaky chair. He'd tap his fingers, humming off-key. "This radio," he'd grin, "seen more history than you!" Now, Grandpa's gone, but sometimes I twist those knobs. The static still hisses, but if I listen real hard, I swear I can hear him humming along. That old radio? It still plays his tunes.
