# Never Paid

After six months of dating, Li Mei realized she had never paid for a single meal. Her boyfriend always insisted on treating her, saying it was his pleasure.

When she mentioned this to friends online, they reacted harshly. "A stubborn fool!" one commented. "Does your girlfriend pay for everything?!" asked another.

Li Mei clarified, "I'm a girl, sisters."

The tone shifted immediately. "Then it's fine, then it's fine," came the relieved response.

Li Mei smiled at her phone. Her boyfriend's generosity wasn't about gender rolesâ€”it was about love. Tomorrow, she decided, she would finally treat him to dinner.
