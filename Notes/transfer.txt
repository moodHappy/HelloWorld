Chapter 50: The Fisherman's Wife

第五十章：渔夫的妻子

They landed on a rocky beach near an abandoned shipyard.

他们在一个废弃船厂附近的乱石滩登陆。

Chen Mo sank the boat. He opened the seacocks and watched the black arrow disappear beneath the waves.

陈默把船沉了。他打开通海阀，看着那支黑色利箭消失在波浪下。

They walked towards a row of small fishing shacks, shivering in the morning wind. Miyetsuko was wearing Chen Mo's jacket, which barely covered her thighs. Her bare feet bled on the sharp rocks.

他们走向一排小渔屋，在晨风中瑟瑟发抖。美悦子穿着陈默的外套，勉强盖住大腿。她的赤脚在尖锐的岩石上流血。

"There," Chen Mo pointed to a drying rack outside a shack. Some worker's overalls and rubber boots were hanging there.

“那儿，”陈默指着一个棚屋外的晾衣架。挂着几件工人的连体工作服和橡胶靴。

They stole them.

他们偷了衣服。

Ten minutes later, inside a public bathroom in a nearby park.

十分钟后，附近公园的公厕里。

Miyetsuko put on the gray, grease-stained mechanic's jumpsuit. It was hideous. It was baggy and smelled of diesel.

美悦子穿上了那件灰色的、沾满油污的机械师连体服。这衣服丑爆了。肥大，而且有股柴油味。

"I look like a potato," she complained, looking in the cracked mirror.

“我看起来像个土豆，”她看着破碎的镜子抱怨。
But then she zipped it up. Or tried to.

但随后她拉上拉链。或者说试图拉上。

The jumpsuit was designed for a skinny man. When the zipper reached her chest, it got stuck. Her breasts were simply too large for the cut. She had to force it, compressing her flesh painfully until the fabric was stretched to its limit across her bust.

这件连体服是给瘦削男人设计的。当拉链拉到胸口时，卡住了。她的胸部对于这个剪裁来说实在太大了。她不得不硬拉，痛苦地挤压着肉体，直到布料在胸前被撑到了极限。

"It's not a potato," Chen Mo watched her struggle. "It's a bomb wrapped in canvas."

“不是土豆，”陈默看着她的挣扎。“是用帆布包着的炸弹。”

She rolled up the sleeves and pant legs. The rough fabric rubbed against her sensitive, marked skin.

她卷起袖子和裤腿。粗糙的布料摩擦着她敏感、布满痕迹的皮肤。

"We need a car. And we need a phone," she washed her face with cold tap water. "Mishima's bonds are useless until we can launder them. We are billionaires on paper, but beggars in reality."

“我们需要车。还需要电话，”她用冷水洗脸。“三岛的债券在洗白之前就是废纸。我们在纸面上是亿万富翁，在现实里是乞丐。”

"I know a guy in Chiba," Chen Mo said. "An old hacker friend. He runs an internet cafe for refugees."

“我在千叶认识一个人，”陈默说。“一个以前的黑客朋友。他开了一家给难民用的网吧。”

"Is he trustworthy?"

“他可靠吗？”

"He hates Kurosaki more than we do. Kurosaki's drones killed his brother."

“他比我们更恨黑崎。黑崎的无人机杀了他弟弟。”

Miyetsuko tied her wet hair into a ponytail. She looked at her reflection—no longer the pampered wife, nor the leather-clad assassin. She looked like a tired, dangerous blue-collar worker.

美悦子把湿头发扎成马尾。她看着倒影——不再是娇生惯养的太太，也不是穿皮衣的杀手。她看起来像个疲惫、危险的蓝领工人。

"Let's go find your friend. But first..." She turned to Chen Mo, her eyes darkening. "I need to steal some underwear. Going commando in this rough jumpsuit is... torturing me."

“去找你的朋友。但首先……”她转向陈默，眼神暗了下来。“我得去偷条内裤。在这粗布连体服里挂空挡……简直是在折磨我。”
