A Difficult Day

I woke up already tired.

Nothing terrible had happened, but nothing felt right either. My alarm rang three times before I finally got out of bed. The room was cold, and the sky outside looked the same dull gray as my mood.

On the way to work, the bus was late. Again. I checked my phone, hoping for a message that might change the day somehow, but there was nothing—just the same notifications, the same silence.

At work, small problems piled up. A file went missing. A meeting dragged on with no clear point. Someone asked me a question I should have known the answer to, and for a moment, my mind went completely blank. I smiled anyway.

By afternoon, everything felt heavier than it should have. Even simple tasks took more effort. I told myself, Just get through today. That’s enough.

On the way home, it started to rain. I didn’t run. I just walked and let it happen.

At night, I lay in bed, thinking about all the things I hadn’t fixed, hadn’t said, hadn’t become. Then I took a deep breath and turned off the light.

Tomorrow, I told myself, I’ll try again.
