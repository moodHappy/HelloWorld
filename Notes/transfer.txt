Title: The Bench

Every afternoon, Mrs. Harper sat on the same park bench, feeding pigeons. No one ever joined her, until one rainy day, a small boy approached.

"Why do you feed them every day?" he asked.

Mrs. Harper smiled, her eyes distant. "Because they remind me that even small things matter. Every life, even tiny, deserves kindness."

Years later, the boy returned as a man, carrying a basket of bread. Sitting on the same bench, he fed the pigeons silently, remembering the lesson.

Some benches, he realized, hold more than memories—they hold the seeds of who we become.
