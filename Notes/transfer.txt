# My Daily Life

I wake up at 7 AM every day. First, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then I eat breakfast with my family. I usually have bread and milk.

After breakfast, I go to work by bus. I work in an office from 9 AM to 5 PM. I like my job because I help people.

In the evening, I cook dinner for my family. We eat together and talk about our day. After dinner, I watch TV or read a book.

I go to bed at 10 PM. I sleep well because I am tired. I love my simple daily life.
