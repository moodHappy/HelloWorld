The days after that blended together.

Tom stopped counting them.

He woke up, went to work, came home.

Sometimes he ate noodles. Sometimes eggs. Once, he burned toast and laughed at himself.

On Wednesday, the elevator was broken.

He took the stairs, slowly, breathing hard by the fourth floor.

An old man passed him and smiled.

“Almost there,” the man said.

Tom smiled back.

On Thursday, he forgot his headphones.

The bus felt louder than usual.

People talked. Someone argued on the phone. A baby cried.

Tom looked out the window and let the noise pass through him.

On Friday, work ended a little early.

No reason. Just luck.

He walked home instead of taking the bus.

The sky was pale orange, the air cool.

A stray cat sat on the sidewalk.

Tom crouched down and held out his hand.

The cat didn’t move.

That was okay.

At home, he cleaned his room for ten minutes.

Then he stopped.

That was also okay.

That night, his mom called.

Not to ask about breakfast. Just to talk.

They spoke about nothing important.

Weather. A neighbor. A TV show she liked.

After the call, Tom felt lighter.

Before sleep, he thought about the week.

Nothing big had happened.

No wins. No losses.

Just days, stacked quietly together.

He turned onto his side.

Tomorrow was Saturday.

He didn’t set an alarm.

He didn’t need to.
