After 21 years on the lam, the FBI's most wanted eco-terrorist is finally in custody. Daniel Andreas San Diego, who'd been dodging authorities since 2003 when he allegedly bombed two California businesses linked to animal testing, was found hiding out in a Welsh cottage. Can you believe it? All that time, thinking he'd outrun the law. The feds had been hot on his trail for years, following leads across multiple countries. But in November 2024, their patience paid off. Agents tracked him down to that remote Welsh hideout, ending one of the longest-running fugitive cases in FBI history. Sometimes, no matter how far you run, the long arm of the law will eventually catch up with you.
