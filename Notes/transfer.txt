The Woman with Grocery Bags

She hurried along the cracked sidewalk, grocery bags swinging from her hands. One bag bulged with vegetables, another sagged under the weight of a small carton of milk. She kept her eyes on the ground, avoiding the puddles left by yesterday’s rain, counting steps almost mechanically.

她沿着裂开的街道快步前行，手里的购物袋随步伐摆动。一个袋子鼓鼓的，装着蔬菜；另一个袋子下垂，承载着一小盒牛奶。她眼睛盯着地面，避开昨天雨水留下的水洼，几乎机械地数着步子。

She lived alone in the apartment above the old tailor shop, though no one visiting would know that. The space was quiet, meticulously kept, every object in its place. Cooking, cleaning, folding laundry—these were her rituals, her way of marking the passage of time. The city outside was unpredictable, but inside, she could maintain order.

她独自住在老裁缝店楼上的公寓里，但来访的人不会知道。屋子很安静，打理得一丝不苟，每样物品都在自己的位置。做饭、打扫、叠衣服——这是她的仪式，是她标记时间流逝的方式。外面的城市不可预测，但屋子里，她可以保持秩序。

This evening, she had gone out for groceries not because she needed anything urgent, but because the act itself gave her a sense of control. She knew every corner of the streets she walked, every step measured, every turn familiar. Even the cracked sidewalk and puddles had a rhythm she understood.

今晚，她外出买菜，并非出于迫切的需求，而是因为这个行为本身让她感到掌控感。她熟悉每条街角，每一步都计算好，每一次转弯都熟悉。即便裂开的路面和水洼，也有她理解的节奏。

As she crossed the street, she noticed the reflection of a dim streetlight on the dusty window of the tailor shop. For a brief moment, she imagined someone inside, measuring, cutting, shaping—someone shaping something that would never exist. She smiled faintly, almost to herself, then kept walking.

当她过马路时，她注意到裁缝店灰尘覆盖的窗户上反射着昏暗的路灯光。短短一瞬，她想象里面有人在测量、裁剪、塑造——塑造着永远不会存在的东西。她轻轻一笑，几乎是对自己笑了笑，然后继续前行。

The weight of the bags pulled at her hands, but she didn’t mind. There was something grounding in it, a physical proof of her presence in the world. Steps measured, groceries carried, life managed in small, tangible increments. It was enough.

袋子拉扯着她的手，但她并不在意。那是一种扎实的感觉，证明她存在于这个世界。步伐有序，买来的食物被携带，生活被小而具体地管理着。这已经足够。

When she reached the building, she unlocked the door, the hum of the apartment greeting her. She placed the bags on the kitchen counter, arranging them just so. Outside, the city moved on, indifferent, as it always did. Inside, she had her quiet, her measured steps, her ordinary yet exact life.

当她回到公寓，她开锁进门，公寓里传来嗡嗡声迎接她。她把购物袋放在厨房柜台上，整整齐齐地摆好。外面，城市继续前行，无动于衷，一如既往。而屋内，她有她的安静，她的有序步伐，她平凡却精确的生活。
