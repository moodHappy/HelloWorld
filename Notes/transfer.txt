"Hey, you know what would be cool? If our map apps had that 'fog of war' thing from video games! Like, imagine opening Google Maps and your neighborhood is clear, but everything else is covered in clouds. You'd actually have to explore places to reveal them on your map! Last week, I discovered this tiny coffee shop just because I wanted to 'unlock' that part of town. My friends and I are making a game out of it now. Life feels more adventurous when you can't just see everything at once. Who knew getting lost could be this fun?"
