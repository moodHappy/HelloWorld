Chapter 26: The Qipao and the Pit

第二十六章：旗袍与斗兽场

"The Devil's Throat." That was the name of Fantasma's underground casino and fighting pit, buried deep within the labyrinth of the favela.

“魔鬼喉咙”。这是幽灵的地下赌场和格斗场的名字，深埋在贫民窟的迷宫深处。

The air was thick with cigar smoke, the smell of roasted meat, and the roar of a bloodthirsty crowd. In the center, inside a chain-link cage, two fighters were beating each other into pulp.

空气中弥漫着雪茄烟雾、烤肉味和嗜血人群的咆哮声。在中央的铁丝网笼子里，两个拳手正把对方打成肉泥。

Miyetsuko walked in.

美悦子走了进来。

She wasn't wearing Western dress tonight. She wore a black silk Qipao.

今晚她没穿西式礼服。她穿了一件黑色的丝绸旗袍。

It was a garment designed to kill. The high collar gave her an air of forbidden strictness, but the slit... the slit went all the way up to her hip bone, exposing a long, pale leg with every step. The silk was tight, outlining the terrifyingly perfect curve of her waist and the heavy swell of her chest, wrapping her like a second skin of ink.

这是一件为了杀戮而设计的衣服。高领赋予她一种禁欲的严厉感，但开叉……开叉一直延伸到髋骨，每走一步都露出一修长苍白的大腿。丝绸紧紧裹着她，勾勒出那令人恐惧的完美腰线和胸前沉甸甸的起伏，像第二层墨色的皮肤。

She held a folding fan made of black lace.

她手里拿着一把黑色蕾丝折扇。

Chen Mo followed half a step behind. He wore a sharp black suit, no tie, his shirt unbuttoned at the top. He looked like her shadow. Silent. Lethal.

陈默跟在半步之后。他穿着一身利落的黑西装，没打领带，衬衫领口敞开。他看起来像她的影子。沉默。致命。

"Look at them," Miyetsuko whispered behind her fan, her eyes scanning the VIP box above the pit. "Dogs waiting for a bone."

“看他们，”美悦子在扇子后低语，眼睛扫视着斗兽场上方的VIP包厢。“一群等着骨头的狗。”

"Don't get bitten," Chen Mo murmured, his hand hovering near his waist.

“别被咬了，”陈默低语，手悬在腰间。

"I don't get bitten, Chen," she snapped the fan shut. "I break teeth."

“我不会被咬，陈，”她合上扇子。“我会敲碎他们的牙。”
