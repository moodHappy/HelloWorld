Chapter 52: The Cyber-Refugee Camp

第五十二章：网络难民营

They got off in the crumbling district of Chiba. This was the "Shadow City"—a maze of old buildings, pachinko parlors, and sketchy internet cafes.

他们在千叶破败的旧城区下了车。这里是“影子城市”——由老旧建筑、弹子房和可疑网吧组成的迷宫。

"Cyber-Cafe 'Bunker'," Chen Mo pointed to a basement entrance covered in graffiti. "My friend Kenji lives here. He hasn't seen sunlight in three years."

“‘地堡’网吧，”陈默指着一个满是涂鸦的地下室入口。“我朋友健二住在这儿。他三年没见过太阳了。”

They walked down the narrow, sticky stairs. The air got hotter and smelled of instant noodles and ozone.

他们走下狭窄、粘腻的楼梯。空气变得更热，弥漫着方便面和臭氧的味道。

Inside, it was a labyrinth of tiny, semi-private cubicles. The only light came from hundreds of glowing monitors.

里面是由微小的半封闭隔间组成的迷宫。唯一的光源来自数百个发光的显示器。

"Chen?" A voice came from behind a pile of server towers.

“陈？”一个声音从一堆服务器机箱后面传来。

A skinny man with thick glasses and greasy hair emerged. He wore a T-shirt that said "I HATE HUMANS."

一个戴着厚眼镜、头发油腻的瘦削男人钻了出来。他穿着一件印着“我恨人类”的T恤。

"Kenji," Chen Mo nodded. "We need a secure line. And cash. Lots of cash."

“健二，”陈默点头。“我们需要一条安全线路。还有现金。很多现金。”

Kenji looked at Chen Mo, then his eyes drifted to Miyetsuko.

健二看着陈默，然后目光飘到了美悦子身上。

"Who's the chick? She looks like she just crawled out of a sewer," Kenji sneered, pushing up his glasses.

“这妞是谁？她看起来像刚从下水道爬出来的，”健二推了推眼镜冷笑。

Miyetsuko stepped forward. The heavy canvas jumpsuit rustled. She unzipped it down to her sternum to let out some heat—and perhaps to intimidate him. The sudden exposure of that startlingly white, sweat-glistening cleavage in this dark, dirty room made Kenji choke on his own spit.

美悦子走上前。沉重的帆布连体服发出沙沙声。她把拉链拉到了胸骨，想散散热——或许也是为了震慑他。在这昏暗肮脏的房间里，那片惊人雪白、闪着汗光的深沟突然暴露，让健二被自己的口水呛到了。

"I'm the one paying for your next server upgrade, four-eyes," she said, her voice carrying the natural authority of a Queen, even in rags. "Now, show us the terminal."

“我是那个为你下一次服务器升级买单的人，四眼仔，”她说，声音里带着女王天生的威严，哪怕穿着破烂。“现在，带我们去终端。”
