Chapter 65: The Widow's Toast

第六十五章：寡妇的祝酒

Chen Mo closed the laptop. The screen went black.

陈默合上笔记本电脑。屏幕黑了。

"It's done," he said.

“结束了，”他说。

Miyetsuko didn't cheer. She didn't laugh. She just stared at the blank screen where her husband had just died.

美悦子没有欢呼。没有笑。她只是盯着那个刚才她丈夫死去的黑屏。

Seven years of torture. The white kimono. The humiliation. The fear. It all ended in a dirty hallway with a trap set by her lover.

七年的折磨。那件白无垢。那些羞辱。那些恐惧。一切都在这肮脏的走廊里，在她情人设下的陷阱中结束了。

She walked to the window. The rain had stopped. Tokyo was glittering like a jewelry box.

她走到窗边。雨停了。东京像个珠宝盒一样闪闪发光。

"I don't feel sad," she whispered. "Is that wrong?"

“我不觉得难过，”她低声说。“这不对吗？”

"No," Chen Mo walked to her, handing her a fresh glass of wine. "It's freedom."

“不，”陈默走到她身边，递给她一杯新倒的酒。“这是自由。”

She took the glass. She looked at the red liquid, swirling it.

她接过杯子。看着红色的液体，摇晃着。

"To the Widow Kurosaki," she raised the glass to her reflection. "May she rest in peace."

“敬寡妇黑崎，”她对着倒影举杯。“愿她安息。”

"And to the Queen," Chen Mo clinked his glass against hers.

“敬女王，”陈默和她碰杯。

She drank it in one gulp. Then she smashed the glass against the floor.

她一饮而尽。然后把杯子狠狠摔碎在地板上。

"Now," she turned to Chen Mo, grabbing his lapels, her eyes burning with a ferocious light. "The old King is dead. Now we kill the Usurper."

“现在，”她转向陈默，抓住他的翻领，眼里燃烧着凶猛的光。“老国王死了。现在我们要杀篡位者。”

"Mishima," Chen Mo nodded.

“三岛，”陈默点头。

"He won't be as easy as a rat in a maze," she pulled Chen Mo towards the bedroom. "But tonight... tonight I want to sleep. For the first time in seven years, I want to sleep without dreaming."

“他不会像迷宫里的老鼠那么好对付，”她拉着陈默走向卧室。“但今晚……今晚我想睡觉。七年来第一次，我想睡个没有梦的觉。”

Chen Mo picked her up.

陈默抱起她。

"I'll watch over you," he promised.

“我会守着你，”他承诺。

And he did. As the sirens wailed in the distance towards the prison, the Queen slept soundly in the arms of her assassin.

他是这么做的。当远处的警笛声呼啸着冲向监狱时，女王在她的刺客怀里安然入睡。
