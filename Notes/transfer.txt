Grandpa Chen's wrinkled hands worked the dough with practiced care. "This is special dough," he whispered to his granddaughter. As he shaped it into small animals, they came to life in her palms. A bread bird fluttered around the kitchen, a dough puppy wagged its tail. Each morning, Grandpa made magical treats for the village children, bringing smiles to their faces. The secret ingredient, he said, was kindness. When he grew too old to bake, he passed his wooden bowl to his granddaughter. "Now the magic is yours to share," he smiled, as she began her first batch of wonder.
