Before the Wig

假发之前

1. The Name on the Screen

The phone lit up while she was folding shirts, one sleeve tucked into another.

2. How She Knew Him

她是怎么认识他的

She met Zhou Ming five years earlier, at a company dinner she almost skipped.

她是在五年前认识周明的，那是一场她差点没去的公司饭局。

He was not from her department.

He worked with contracts, numbers, and deadlines that never appeared in public.

他做合同、数字和那些从不露面的期限。

They sat next to each other because no one else wanted the corner seats.

He asked practical questions and listened without nodding too much.

When the dinner ended, he walked her to the subway without asking if she needed it.

After that, they spoke every few months.

之后，他们每隔几个月联系一次。

Then more often.

后来频率慢慢变高。

3. The Call Begins

电话开始

“Are you at home?” Zhou Ming asked.

“你在家吗？”周明问。

“Yes,” she said, looking at the sock on the floor.

“在。”她说，看了一眼地上的袜子。

“That’s good,” he said. “I won’t take long.”

“那就好。”他说，“我不会说太久。”

He always said that, and it was usually true.

A document carried her signature, copied from an old file.

“It’s not criminal,” he said. “But it’s enough to be used.”

“不是刑事问题，”他说，“但足够被利用。”

She sat on the edge of the bed.

她坐到床边。

Her hands were still holding a shirt she no longer needed to fold.

手里还抓着一件已经叠好的衬衫。

5. Why He Called Her

他为什么打给她

“I should have warned you earlier,” Zhou Ming said.

“我应该早点告诉你。”周明说。

His voice dropped slightly, the way it did when he talked about himself.

他的声音低了一点，那是他提到自己时的语调。

“I thought I could keep it quiet.”

“我以为我能压住。”

She knew what that meant.

He had tried to handle it alone.

“And now?” she asked.

He did not apologize directly.

He never did.

Instead, he said her name once, carefully.

The room sounded different, as if something had been removed.

She stood up and went to the bathroom.

她站起来，走进浴室。

The mirror reflected her face and the hair around it, still intact.

镜子里，她的脸和那圈完整的头发还在。

She reached up and gathered it in her hand.

她抬手，把头发拢在一起。

It felt heavier than it should.

它比应该的要重。

8. The First Cut

第一刀

She did not think of Zhou Ming when she took the scissors.

她拿起剪刀时，没有再想周明。

She thought of the coming questions, the copied signature, the waiting.

The scissors closed with a dull sound.
