Chapter 7: The Reason for the Pawn

第七章：棋子的理由

Chen Mo grabbed her wrist.

"You lied to me. That night was just a game for you to pass the time?"

陈默一把抓住了她的手腕。

“你骗了我。那晚对你来说，只是打发时间的游戏？”

Miyetsuko didn't struggle; she just looked at him calmly. Her wrist felt cold and delicate in his palm, contrasting sharply with the hot, soft touch of her body in his memory.

美悦子没有挣扎，只是平静地看着他。她的手腕在陈默掌心里显得冰凉细腻，与记忆里她身体那火热绵软的触感截然不同。

"No one tells the truth in Tokyo, Mr. Chen. Truth is a luxury." Her eyes turned slightly cold.

"As for that night... my body doesn't lie. I enjoyed your 'comfort.' It had been a long time since I tasted such fresh, clumsy enthusiasm."

“在东京没人说真话，陈先生。真话是奢侈品。”她的眼神微微冷了下来。

“至于那晚……我的身体没有撒谎。我很享受你的‘慰藉’。很久没尝过那么新鲜、笨拙的热情了。”

She shook off Chen Mo's hand fiercely, took a step back, and her tone turned strictly business.

她猛地甩开陈默的手，后退了一步，语气变得公事公办。

"I left the lipstick. I also left the key card. Because I need you."

“口红是我留下的。房卡也是我留下的。因为我需要你。”

"Need me to do what? Be your secret lover?" Chen Mo mocked.

“需要我做什么？做你的秘密情人？”陈默嘲讽道。

"Don't flatter yourself. My husband has plenty of lovers; I don't need another trouble."

She walked to the bar and poured two glasses of whiskey.

“I丈夫的情人多得是，我不需要再给自己找麻烦。”

她走到吧台边，倒了两杯威士忌。

"I checked your background. You are a senior data analyst at a mid-sized IT company. Your life is simple, background clean, and most importantly—you have absolutely no connection to the Kurosaki Group's sphere of influence."

“我查过你的背景。你是中型IT公司的高级数据分析师。生活简单，背景干净，最重要的是——你和黑崎集团的势力范围毫无瓜葛。”

She turned around and handed a glass of liquor to Chen Mo.

她转过身，将一杯酒递给陈默。

"I am being watched very closely. Anyone I contact in Tokyo will be reported to that old immortal man immediately."

“我被盯得很紧。我在东京接触的任何人，都会立刻汇报给那个老不死的东西。”

"Only you. You are an accident outside the plan, a variable he cannot see."

“只有你。你是个计划外的意外，是他看不见的变量。”

"The numbers in the lipstick..." Chen Mo asked tentatively.

“口红里的数字……”陈默试探着问。

"You found it. Good."

“你发现了。很好。”

"That's the coordinates of a vault. Next week, the 24th. I need you to use your professional skills to help me take something out of there."

“那是一个金库的坐标。下周，24号。我需要你用你的专业技能，帮我从那里带点东西出来。”

"Something that can let me breathe freely in this Kurosaki family hell."

“能让我在黑崎家这个地狱里，喘口气的东西。”

"Help me do this, and I promise you, the reward you get will be a hundred times better than that night in Izu."

“帮我做这件事，我向你保证，你得到的报酬，会比伊豆那晚好上一百倍。”

"You will truly... own me once."

“你会真正地……拥有我一次。”
