Remember those old horror mags from the 70s? Let me tell you one I read in a dusty corner shop once. This guy buys an antique mirror for his new apartment. Weird thing is, he starts seeing a woman in the reflection who's not really there. One night, he wakes up to find her standing beside his bed, whispering, "You're in my place now." The next morning, he finds an old newspaper clipping behind the mirrorâ€”about a woman murdered in that exact apartment 50 years ago. He never slept in that room again.
