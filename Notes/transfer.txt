The Woman on the Platform

She stood at the edge of the platform, checking the departure board for the third time in as many minutes.

她站在站台边，三分钟内已经第三次查看发车牌。

Her coat was too heavy for the morning, but she didn’t take it off.

早晨有些热，她的外套很厚，但她没有脱下。

Every time the board updated, she tilted her head, squinting as if the letters were rearranging themselves.

每次电子屏刷新，她都歪着头，眯起眼睛，好像字母在不断重排。

A man sitting on a bench glanced at her, then returned to his newspaper.

长椅上的男人瞥了她一眼，又低头看报纸。

She murmured something under her breath, too soft for anyone else to hear.

她低声自语，声音小到别人听不见。

When the train arrived, she stepped back, hesitated, and then moved forward again.

火车到站时，她退了一步，又犹豫着向前走。

The doors opened, she paused, and glanced at the board one last time.

车门打开，她停下脚步，最后看了一眼发车牌。

Then she stepped on. The train pulled away.

然后她上了车，火车启动。

Outside, the city continued as usual, indifferent to her caution.

窗外的城市照常运转，对她的谨慎毫不在意。

Her reflection in the glass caught her by surprise, and for a moment she smiled.

玻璃上的倒影让她有些意外，片刻间，她笑了。

When the train disappeared around the curve, the platform felt empty.

火车绕过弯道消失时，站台显得空旷。

She had left no note, no trace, only the faint echo of footsteps and a coat too heavy for the morning.

她没有留下字条，也没有留下痕迹，只留下轻微的脚步声和那件早晨太厚的外套。
