# The Kind Rabbit

Once, a rabbit saw a turtle struggling in a muddy puddle. Instead of laughing, the rabbit jumped in and helped the turtle out. The turtle said, "Thank you! Why did you help me? Most animals just laugh at me."

The rabbit replied, "Because helping someone feels good. And you know, I might need help someday too."

A few weeks later, the rabbit fell into a hole and couldn't get out. The turtle saw her and called his friends. Together, they pulled the rabbit out.

The rabbit smiled. "See? Kindness comes back to you when you least expect it!"

Moral: Be kind to others. You never know when you might need their help.
