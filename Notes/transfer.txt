Chapter 10: The Friday Feeling

第十章：周五的悸动

The morning sun streamed through the classroom windows, dancing on the wooden desks. It was Friday, and the air was thick with a restless excitement. The usual gloom of the school week had lifted, replaced by the buzz of weekend plans.

晨光透过教室窗户洒在木桌上。今天是周五，空气中弥漫着一种躁动的兴奋感。往日那种沉闷的厌学情绪一扫而空，取而代之的是对周末计划的热烈讨论。

Miyetsuko sat in her usual seat, looking every bit the model student. Her hair was neatly tied, and her blouse was crisp and white. No one looking at her could ever imagine the scenes from the night before. But under the desk, her legs were crossed tightly, the memory of the cold park slide still lingering in her muscles.

美悦子坐在惯常的位置上，一副模范生的模样。头发梳理得整整齐齐，衬衫洁白笔挺。任谁看她，都无法想象昨晚发生的那些画面。但在课桌下，她的双腿紧紧交叠，公园滑梯那股冰冷的感觉似乎还残留在肌肉里。

Shiraishi walked into the room, looking energized and annoyingly handsome in the morning light. As he passed Miyetsuko’s desk, he didn't stop, but his hand lightly brushed against her shoulder. It was a fleeting touch, invisible to the rest of the class, but it sent a jolt of electricity straight to her core.

白石走进教室，在晨光下显得精力充沛，帅气得让人心烦。经过美悦子课桌时，他没停步，手却轻盈地掠过她的肩膀。那是一个极其短暂的触碰，班上没人发现，却让美悦子感到一阵电流直冲心底。

He caught her eye for a split second and winked. The dark, heavy mood of the previous night had vanished. Today, he wasn't just her escape; he was the reason she was smiling behind her textbook. Friday meant they had the whole evening to themselves, and the anticipation was already making her heart race.

他与她对视了一瞬，眨了眨眼。昨晚那种沉重压抑的情绪消失了。今天，他不只是她的避风港，更是让她躲在课本后偷笑的原因。周五意味着他们拥有一整晚的私密时光，这种期待感已经让她的心跳加速了。
