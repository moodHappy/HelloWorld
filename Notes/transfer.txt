Chapter 27: The Black Container

第二十七章：黑色集装箱

Three days later. Port of Rio. Night.

三天后。里约港。夜晚。

A massive cargo ship, The Black Pearl, was being loaded.

一艘巨大的货轮“黑珍珠号”正在装货。

Fantasma stood on the dock, hugging Miyetsuko.

幽灵站在码头上，拥抱美悦子。

"You are a crazy woman, Tanaka," the drug lord laughed. "But I will miss you. You made me a lot of money."

“你是个疯女人，田中，”毒枭大笑。“但我会想你的。你让我赚了很多钱。”

"Keep the channel open, Fantasma. When I take Tokyo, I'll need a supplier," Miyetsuko winked.

“保持渠道畅通，幽灵。等我拿下东京，我需要一个供应商，”美悦子眨眼。

She walked up the gangplank. She wore a black trench coat over a tactical vest. No more bikinis. No more gowns. She was dressed for war.

她走上跳板。她在战术背心外面穿了一件黑色风衣。没有比基尼了。没有晚礼服了。她是为战争而装扮的。

Chen Mo followed, carrying two heavy duffel bags.

陈默跟在后面，提着两个沉重的行李袋。

They entered a specially modified shipping container. Inside, it was a mobile command center. Satellite links, weapon racks, and a small, comfortable bed bolted to the floor.

他们走进一个经过特殊改装的集装箱。里面是一个移动指挥中心。卫星链接，武器架，还有一张固定在地板上的、舒适的小床。

The doors closed with a heavy thud. Darkness enveloped them, save for the red emergency lights.

门沉重地砰一声关上了。除了红色的应急灯，黑暗吞没了他们。

"Next stop: Tokyo," Chen Mo locked the door.

“下一站：东京，”陈默锁上了门。

Miyetsuko sat on the bed, checking her new weapon—a silenced MP7 submachine gun.

美悦子坐在床上，检查着她的新武器——一把消音的MP7冲锋枪。

"It's a long trip, Chen," she looked up at him in the red light. The confined space, the vibration of the ship's engine, the anticipation of violence... the atmosphere was thick.

“旅途很长，陈，”她在红光下抬头看他。狭窄的空间，船引擎的震动，对暴力的期待……空气变得粘稠。

"We have time," Chen Mo sat beside her.

“我们有的是时间，”陈默坐在她身边。

"Good," she pushed him back onto the mattress. She straddled him, the tactical vest pressing against his chest. "Because I intend to practice my 'victory dance' all the way across the Pacific."

“很好，”她把他推倒在床垫上。她跨坐在他身上，战术背心压在他的胸口。“因为我打算在横跨太平洋的路上，好好练习我的‘胜利之舞’。”
