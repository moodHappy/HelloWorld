When Chen's fiancée demanded 300,000 yuan as bride price, his mother smiled knowingly. "Magic defeats magic," she whispered to her son. That night, the mother-in-law spread a white cloth on the bed, intending to verify the bride's virginity. But Chen, the "mama's boy" everyone mocked, had prepared. He presented his own contract: financial transparency, shared household responsibilities, and mutual respect—no virginity test required. The bride's family was stunned. In this battle of traditions, Chen had found his safe harbor not in blind obedience, but in modern values. Sometimes, the real magic is having the courage to challenge outdated customs.
