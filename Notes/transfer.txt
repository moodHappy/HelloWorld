Leaving the Noise of the City

离开城市的喧闹

He took an early train to a coastal town where no one from the office would appear.

他坐清晨的火车去了一个沿海小镇，那里不会遇到公司的人。

The platform was quiet, and the wind carried the smell of salt and wet wood.

He walked to a small guesthouse near the shore and checked in with a handwritten form.

他走到海边一间小旅馆，用手写登记表办理入住。

In the dining room, a woman was arranging cups for the morning guests.

餐厅里，一个女人正在给早来的客人摆放杯子。

She wore simple clothes, and her hair was tied loosely behind her neck.

她穿着简单的衣服，头发松松地扎在脖子后面。

When she turned to move a chair, he noticed the calm way she handled every object.

她转身挪动椅子时，他注意到她做每个动作都很从容。

She greeted him as a traveler, not as someone important.

她把他当普通旅客打招呼，而不是重要人物。

He ordered tea and sat near the window facing the sea.

他点了一杯茶，坐在面对大海的窗边。

Her husband arrived later with fresh bread from a nearby shop.

她的丈夫后来从附近面包店带回刚出炉的面包。

They spoke about the weather, the ferry schedule, and the number of visitors this season.

他们谈天气、渡船时间，还有这个季节的游客数量。

No one asked about his job or the city he came from.

没有人问他的工作，也没有人问他来自哪座城市。

In the afternoon, he walked along the shore and saw her hanging towels in the sun.

下午，他沿着海边走，看见她在阳光下晾毛巾。

She waved once, then continued her work without trying to talk longer.

她挥了一下手，又继续做事，没有多说。

The tide moved slowly, covering the footprints left by strangers.

潮水慢慢上涨，把陌生人留下的脚印盖住。

That evening, he returned to the guesthouse before the streetlights turned on.

傍晚路灯亮起前，他回到了旅馆。

She placed a simple dinner in front of him and reminded him the kitchen would close early.

她把一份简单的晚餐放到他面前，提醒厨房会早些关门。

He thanked her and ate quietly while the sound of waves entered through the open door.

他道谢后安静地吃饭，海浪声从敞开的门口传进来。

For the first time in months, nothing from the city followed him into the night.

这是几个月来，第一次没有任何城市里的事跟着他进入夜晚。
