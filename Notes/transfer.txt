Chapter 49: The Naked Dawn

第四十九章：赤裸的黎明

Hours later. Or maybe minutes. Time had lost its meaning.

几小时后。或者几分钟。时间失去了意义。

The eastern horizon began to turn a bruised purple. The first light of dawn crept over the Pacific.

东方的地平线开始变成淤青般的紫色。黎明的第一缕光爬过了太平洋。

Chen Mo lay on the leather seat, exhausted. Miyetsuko lay curled up on the floor of the boat, using his jacket as a blanket.

陈默精疲力竭地躺在皮座椅上。美悦子蜷缩在船的地板上，把他的外套当毯子盖。

The sunlight hit her.

阳光打在她身上。

It was a cruel, beautiful sight. Her naked body was covered in marks—bruises from the fight, red welts from the tight leather suit, and darker hickeys from Chen Mo. She looked like a masterpiece painting that had been slashed by a vandal.

那是残酷而美丽的一幕。她赤裸的身体上布满了痕迹——打斗留下的淤青，紧身皮衣勒出的红印，还有陈默留下的深色吻痕。她看起来像一幅被暴徒划破的杰作名画。

But she was sleeping peacefully. Her chest rose and fell rhythmically, that magnificent weight shifting gently with gravity.

但她睡得很安详。胸口有节奏地起伏，那宏伟的重量随着重力轻轻移动。

Chen Mo checked the fuel gauge. 15%.

陈默检查了油量表。15%。

"Wake up," he nudged her gently with his foot. "We need to land before the Coast Guard wakes up."

“醒醒，”他用脚轻轻碰了碰她。“我们得在海岸警卫队醒来之前靠岸。”

Miyetsuko opened one eye. It was bloodshot but clear.

美悦子睁开一只眼。眼里布满血丝，但很清醒。

"Where are we?" She sat up, the jacket sliding off. She didn't bother to cover herself. In this vast ocean, shame was a luxury they left back in Tokyo.

“我们在哪？”她坐起来，外套滑落。她没费心去遮掩。在这片广阔的海洋上，羞耻心是他们留在东京的奢侈品。

"Drifted south. Chiba Prefecture. Kisarazu coast," Chen Mo pointed to the distant coastline. "Industrial zone. Lots of noise, lots of smoke. Easy to hide."

“向南漂了。千叶县。木更津海岸，”陈默指着远处的海岸线。“工业区。噪音大，烟雾多。容易藏身。”

"My clothes are ruined," she kicked the pile of wet leather. "I can't walk into a city naked with a gun holster."

“我的衣服毁了，”她踢了踢那一堆湿皮衣。“我不能光着身子、戴着枪套走进城市。”

"We'll find something," Chen Mo started the engine. "Even a trash bag looks like haute couture on you."

“我们会找到穿的，”陈默启动引擎。“哪怕是个垃圾袋，穿在你身上也像高定。”

Miyetsuko laughed, a raspy morning sound. She stood up, stretching her limbs. The sunlight illuminated the curve of her waist and the shadow of her hips.

美悦子笑了，那是沙哑的清晨笑声。她站起来，伸展四肢。阳光照亮了她腰肢的曲线和臀部的阴影。

"Flattery won't get you a second round, Chen. I'm hungry. I want steak."

“奉承话换不来第二回合，陈。我饿了。我想吃牛排。”
