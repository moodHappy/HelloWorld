# Beyond the Palace Walls

My father, King Aldric, ruled with an iron fist wrapped in velvet gloves. To the kingdom, he was a formidable monarch, just and powerful. But to me, he was simply Father—the man who taught me to ride horses and whose laughter echoed through the palace corridors when I was young.

As I grew older, the crown seemed to grow heavier between us. Royal duties consumed his days, and I often dined alone, save for the silent servants who moved like shadows around me. I missed the father who once bandaged my scraped knees and told stories by the fireplace.

On my sixteenth birthday, Father surprised me with an unprecedented gift—a day beyond the palace walls, disguised as commoners. We walked through the marketplace, his hand occasionally squeezing mine with unfamiliar nervousness. For the first time, I saw him not as a king, but as a man who loved his daughter deeply.

"People don't realize how lonely the crown can be," he confessed over simple bread and cheese at a small inn. "But seeing you happy today makes every sacrifice worthwhile."

That day changed everything. I understood the weight he carried and the love that drove him. He was still my king, but more importantly, he was my father. And in that knowledge, I found a kingdom's worth of love.
