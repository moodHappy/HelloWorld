After abandoning her husband and young daughter twelve years ago, Li Mei vanished without a trace. She lived a carefree life in another city, forgetting the family she left behind.

Standing before her now-grown daughter, Li Mei demanded her share of the funds. "I'm his legal wife," she declared coldly.

"The money is for those who stayed."
