From Window to Forever — The Light Across the Alley

Months passed. Seasons changed. Mark returned to the city finally for good.

Anna was waiting at the station, her hair tied back, suitcase at her side, smiling like she had rehearsed it a hundred times in her head.

“Welcome back,” she said.

Mark laughed, a little nervously. “Feels like coming home.”

And it did.

They moved into a small apartment near the same alley, the one where it had all begun. The window still caught the evening light perfectly, but now it was theirs together. They cooked, argued over tiny things, laughed at burned toast, and stayed up late talking about nothing in particular.

Mark proposed one rainy afternoon, leaning against the window with Anna’s hand in his. She said yes before he could even finish the sentence.

The wedding was lively. Friends and family crowded into a bright hall, laughter bouncing off the walls. Anna wore a simple dress with a train she didn’t need, and Mark kept checking to make sure she was smiling. When they exchanged vows, the world outside—the alley, the city, the distance that had once defined them—felt far away and irrelevant.

They danced, clumsily at first, then perfectly in sync, the kind of sync that comes from years of small, shared moments, long walks, and quiet nights.

Years passed. They grew older, softer around the edges but still laughing at the same silly jokes. Their home filled with books, plants, and light that never flickered. On weekends, they walked the streets near the alley, hand in hand, remembering the first time they met under the yellow glow of that window.

Mark sometimes teased, “Remember when I just watched you from across the alley?”

Anna would smile, squeeze his hand, and reply, “I always knew you’d come around.”

And they stayed like that, quietly happy, until their hair turned gray, the light still warm and steady in their home, the alley now a memory, not a boundary.
