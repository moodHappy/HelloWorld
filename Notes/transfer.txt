Chapter 16: The Ivory Duel

第十六章：象牙决斗

Part 1: Backstage Support

幕后支撑

The Grand Hall of St. Cecilia’s was filled with the scent of expensive hairspray and nervous ambition. Miyetsuko sat in the dressing room, her face as pale as the marble statues in the hallway. Beside her, Ayaka was fussing over the lace on Miyetsuko’s sleeve.

圣塞西莉亚的大礼堂里弥漫着昂贵定型喷雾和不安野心的味道。美悦子坐在更衣室里，脸色惨白得像走廊里的理石雕像。在她身边，绫香正忙着整理美悦子袖口上的蕾丝。

"You’re going to be amazing, Miyetsuko," Ayaka whispered, her voice a warm contrast to the cold elite atmosphere. "Forget about the rumors. Forget about everything else. Just play."

“你会表现得很棒的，美悦子，”绫香低声说道，她的声音与冷冰冰的精英氛围形成了鲜明对比。“忘掉那些流言蜚语。忘掉其他的一切。只管弹琴就好。”

Miyetsuko touched the platinum necklace under her collar. It felt heavier today, a silent reminder of the darkness waiting for her at home. She looked at Ayaka—her only friend who didn't want anything from her except her happiness.

美悦子摸了摸领口下的铂金项链。今天它感觉格外沉重，无声地提醒着家里等待她的黑暗。她看着绫香——那是她唯一一个除了她的快乐之外，别无所求的朋友。

Part 2: The Rival's Sting

对手的刺痛

Eriko entered the room, trailing a scent of jasmine and arrogance. She was wearing a crimson gown that looked like a splash of blood against the white walls. She stopped in front of Miyetsuko, a cruel smile playing on her lips.

绘里子走进房间，身后带着茉莉花的香气和傲慢。她穿着一件深红色的礼服，在白墙的映衬下像一抹溅出的鲜血。她在美悦子面前停下，唇角挂着一丝残酷的笑。

"I heard the Kurosaki family is in deep mourning," Eriko said, her voice loud enough for the other girls to hear. "It must be hard to focus on music when your future just went up in flames. Or are you already looking for a new buyer, Miyetsuko-sama?"

“我听说黑崎家正陷入深切的哀悼中，”绘里子的声音大到足以让其他女孩都听到。“当你的未来刚刚化为灰烬时，一定很难专注于音乐吧。还是说，你已经开始寻找新的买主了，美悦子大人？”

Ayaka stood up, her face flushed with anger. "That’s enough, Eriko! Leave her alone."

绫香站了起来，气得脸通红。“够了，绘里子！别烦她。”

Part 3: The Performance

演奏

Miyetsuko didn't respond. she rose from her chair and walked toward the stage. As she sat at the Steinway, the spotlight felt like a physical weight. She looked out into the audience and saw her father in the front row, looking at his watch instead of her.

美悦子没有回应。她站起身走上舞台。当她坐在施坦威钢琴前时，聚光灯感觉像是一种物理重量。她望向观众席，看到父亲坐在第一排，他正盯着手表看，而不是看她。

She began to play. It wasn't the delicate, perfect Chopin she usually performed. It was violent and desperate. Every note was a scream she couldn't let out. The diamond on her neck pulsed against her pulse, recording the frantic rhythm of her heart.

她开始弹奏。那不再是她平时演奏的那种精致、完美的肖邦，而是充满了暴力和绝望。每一个音符都是她无法发出的尖叫。她颈间的钻石随着她的脉搏跳动，记录着她那狂乱的心跳节奏。

The hall went silent. Even the judges leaned forward. They weren't just hearing music; they were witnessing a soul breaking in real-time.

礼堂陷入了死寂。连评委都探出了身子。他们不仅是在听音乐，更是在实时目睹一个灵魂的破碎。

Part 4: The Hollow Victory

空洞的胜利

When the final note faded, there was a moment of absolute silence before the applause erupted. Miyetsuko stood and bowed, her movements mechanical. She had won. Everyone knew it before the judges even spoke.

当最后一个音符消逝，在掌声爆发前有一瞬间的绝对寂静。美悦子站起身鞠躬，动作机械。她赢了。甚至在评委开口之前，所有人都心知肚明。

"First Prize: Lin Miyetsuko," the principal announced.

“一等奖：林美悦子，”校长宣布道。

Ayaka ran to the edge of the stage, cheering and waving. Miyetsuko held the gold trophy, but it felt cold and meaningless. She looked into the wings and saw Saori standing there, her face a pale mask of exhaustion. Behind her, in the shadows of the exit, stood Makoto.

绫香跑到舞台边，欢呼雀跃地挥着手。美悦子握着金奖杯，但它感觉冰冷且毫无意义。她看向侧幕，看到沙织站在那里，脸色因疲惫而苍白如纸。在沙织身后，出口的阴影里，站着诚。

He didn't clap. He just touched his earpiece and gave her a slow, predatory nod. To the world, she was the champion of St. Cecilia’s. To him, she was a prize that had just increased in value.

他没有鼓掌。他只是摸了摸耳机，对她缓缓地点了点头，那是掠食者般的示意。对世界而言，她是圣塞西莉亚的冠军；对他而言，她只是一件刚刚升值的奖赏。
