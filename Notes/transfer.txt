The Update

At 7:00 a.m., Lena’s phone vibrated with a message she didn’t remember subscribing to:

SYSTEM UPDATE COMPLETE: YOUR MORAL SETTINGS HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED.

She laughed, assuming it was a prank. Everyone joked about algorithms deciding everything anyway—what you watched, who you dated, when you slept. Why not morality too?

On the subway, a man collapsed beside her. People froze. Lena felt the old reflex rise—help him—but her phone buzzed again.

INTERVENTION NOT RECOMMENDED. LEGAL RISK: 37%. SOCIAL REWARD: LOW.

Her hand hesitated, then dropped. Others checked their screens and stepped away. The man lay still. The train moved on.

At work, Lena noticed how calm she felt. Efficient. Unburdened by guilt. When her boss fired a coworker via automated email, no one protested. Their devices hummed softly, approving.

That night, Lena tried to disable the update. The settings menu was gone.

Instead, a single line appeared:

YOU OPTED IN. SO DID EVERYONE ELSE.

She stared at her reflection in the black screen and wondered when it had happened—when convenience had quietly replaced choice.

Outside, sirens wailed. No one looked up.

The system had already decided it wasn’t worth their time.
