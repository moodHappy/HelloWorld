Hey, you won't believe this funny story from Brisbane! So this family had a trampoline in their backyard, right? One day, a kangaroo hops by and decides to check it out. The roo starts bouncing around and seems to have a blast! But get this - the kangaroo must have texted his mates because soon enough, a whole bunch of kangaroos showed up for a trampoline party! Lucky for us, someone's security camera caught the whole thing. It was so hilarious that it ended up on Australian TV news. Imagine looking out your window and seeing a bunch of kangaroos on your trampoline!
