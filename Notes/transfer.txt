# The Fifteen Yuan Saved from Not Washing the Car

Liu Wei drove his dusty car to the car wash but hesitated at the 15 yuan fee. "I can wash it myself," he thought. That weekend, he spent an hour cleaning his car, getting soaked in the process. As he dried off, he noticed his elderly neighbor struggling with groceries. He spent his saved money on lunch for her instead. She smiled warmly, sharing stories of her youth. Liu Wei realized that sometimes the smallest savings can create the most valuable moments. His car wasn't perfectly clean, but his heart felt fuller than ever.
