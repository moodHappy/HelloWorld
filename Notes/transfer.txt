Company Micro Harvest is helping with the growing need for more protein.

They use tiny living things in a closed space, called a Bioreactor. This is a quick way to make protein. Other ways usually take a long time. Micro Harvest finishes the process in just one day. The protein which they make has a good taste.

The protein can go into different foods, even for pets. Bakers wants to start small, like in a local store or restaurant, and then grow. There are some rules to follow, but the company hopes that it will be possible to make food for people, too.
