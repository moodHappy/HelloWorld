Chapter 62: The Dance of Lead and Silk

第六十二章：铅弹与丝绸的舞蹈

"Stairs! Go!" Chen Mo grabbed her arm. The elevator chimed—reinforcements were coming.

“楼梯！走！”陈默抓住她的胳膊。电梯响了——增援到了。

They sprinted towards the fire exit.

他们冲向防火通道。

But the "Vengeance Red" gown was a problem. The tight skirt restricted her stride.

但这件“复仇红”礼服是个问题。紧身裙摆限制了她的步伐。

"Damn it!" Miyetsuko cursed, stumbling on the first step. "Fashion is the real enemy!"

“该死！”美悦子在第一级台阶上绊了一下，咒骂道。“时尚才是真正的敌人！”

She stopped. She didn't hesitate. She grabbed the high slit of her dress with both hands and ripped it upwards.

她停下。毫不犹豫。双手抓住裙子的高开叉，用力向上撕开。

RIIIP—

嘶啦——

The sound of tearing silk echoed in the stairwell.

丝绸撕裂的声音在楼梯间回荡。

She tore the skirt all the way to her hip bone. The dress was now essentially a loincloth, revealing her entire legs and the black lace panties she had teased Chen Mo with at dinner.

她把裙摆一直撕到了髋骨。这件礼服现在基本上成了一块遮羞布，完全暴露了她的双腿和那条在晚餐时挑逗陈默的黑色蕾丝内裤。

"Better," she kicked off her 10cm heels, leaving them on the stairs. "Now I can run."

“好多了，”她踢掉10厘米的高跟鞋，把它们留在楼梯上。“现在我能跑了。”

She looked back at Chen Mo, breathless, her hair wild, her legs bare and muscular. She looked like an Amazon warrior in a ruined ballgown.

她回头看陈默，气喘吁吁，头发狂乱，双腿赤裸而有力。她看起来像个穿着破烂舞裙的亚马逊女战士。

"Stop staring at my legs, Chen! Shoot behind us!"

“别盯着我的腿看，陈！往后射击！”

Chen Mo turned and fired three shots at the door as Mishima's men burst through.

陈默转身，在三岛的人撞开门的瞬间开了三枪。

They ran up. Flight 41. Flight 42... towards the roof.

他们向上跑。41层。42层……冲向屋顶。
