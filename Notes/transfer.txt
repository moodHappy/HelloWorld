The Question at the Door

门口的问题

She leaned against the doorframe, the light behind her low and warm.

她靠在门框上，身后的灯光压得很低，很暖。

The air smelled of soap and heat, the kind that lingers on skin after a shower.

空气里有肥皂味和热气，是洗过澡后留在皮肤上的那种。

He had not planned to stay. He had planned to leave five minutes ago.

他本来没打算留下。本来五分钟前就该走。

She lifted her chin, slow, deliberate, letting the silence stretch.

她慢慢抬起下巴，很刻意，让沉默被拉长。

“Do you like my new thong?” she said.

“你喜欢我的新丁字裤吗？”她说。

The words were light. The room was not.

话很轻，房间却不是。

He looked at her legs first, then forced his eyes back to her face.

他先看了她的腿，又强迫自己把视线拉回她的脸。

The fabric was barely there, black against skin, a private detail made public on purpose.

布料几乎不存在，黑色贴着皮肤，一个被故意展示出来的私密细节。

He swallowed. The clock on the wall ticked once, loud enough to count.

他咽了口唾沫。墙上的钟走了一下，响得能数清。

“You shouldn’t ask me that,” he said.

“你不该问我这个。”他说。

She smiled, small and sharp, as if that was exactly the point.

她笑了一下，很小，很锋利，像是正中要害。

“I didn’t ask what I should do,” she said.

“我没问我该不该。”她说。

The heat climbed his neck. He could feel it in his ears, his palms.

热意顺着他的脖子往上爬，耳朵和手心都在发烫。

Outside, a car passed. Somewhere else, someone’s life was continuing on schedule.

窗外有车经过。别的地方，有人的生活正按部就班。

He knew whose place this was. He knew who he was not.

他知道这是谁的地方，也知道自己不是什么人。

Still, he didn’t move.

可他没有动。

She took one step closer. Not touching. Just close enough to change the air.

她向前走了一步，没有碰到他，只是近到足以改变空气。

He answered at last, his voice lower than he intended.

他终于回答了，声音比自己预想的还低。

“Yes.”

“喜欢。”
