Title: "Iran and Israel Continue to Exchange Strikes"

Iran and Israel are still fighting, with both countries attacking each other. The conflict started four days ago and has already caused many deaths and injuries. 

Iran launched fresh missile strikes on Israel overnight, killing five people and injuring dozens. Israel has also attacked Iran, hitting nuclear facilities, military sites, and populated areas. Iran has responded with drones and ballistic missiles.

The US President, Donald Trump, says that the two countries should make a deal to stop the fighting. However, Iran says it will not negotiate while it is being attacked. 

The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says that the goal is not to reduce the fighting but to stop Iran from developing its nuclear capability. 

Many people have been killed in the conflict, with at least 224 people killed in Iranian attacks on Israel since Friday. The US Embassy in Israel remains closed due to the conflict.

The international community is concerned about the situation, with many calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, it is unclear when the fighting will stop.
