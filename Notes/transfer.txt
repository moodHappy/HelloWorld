Last week I bought a device called Dreamweaver, a bridge between science fiction and fantasy. It promises future tech and magical stories. You select a scene: a starship docked by a floating castle, or a village where rain tastes like memory. Wearing the headset, my room dissolves into neon air and ladders that lead to the sky. Soon the engine asks for a price: a memory, a secret, a name I barely recall. Each night it adds a chapter about me, changing the person I am. I sign to stay inside forever. Then the screen goes black, and I wake with a life I did not choose.
