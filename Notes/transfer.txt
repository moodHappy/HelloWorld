I was walking home when I heard shouting from the old warehouse downtown. Being nosey, I peeked through a broken window and saw it - a guy arguing with another, then bam! A knife appeared. Next thing I know, one's on the floor, and the other's running out the back. My heart was pounding like crazy. I called the cops, gave them my statement. They found the guy hiding in his apartment. Turns out it was over some money they owed each other. Crazy how a simple argument can turn deadly, huh? The papers called it "The Warehouse Murder," but to me, it's just sad.
