"咸鱼"

"Hey, get up! It's already noon!" Mike shouted at his roommate Tom.

Tom rolled over on the couch. "Nah, I'm good. Just five more minutes."

"You've been saying that for three days! You're such a 咸鱼!"

Tom grinned. "What's wrong with being a salted fish? We're preserved, relaxed, and last forever."

"That's not how it works! You need to find a job, or at least shower!"

"Tomorrow," Tom mumbled, already half-asleep. "A salted fish's philosophy: why do today what you can postpone indefinitely?"

Mike sighed. "You're impossible."

"Just salty," Tom chuckled.
