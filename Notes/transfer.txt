Chapter 2: Afterglow and Class Time

第 2 章：余温与课间

Miyetsuko stood before the cracked mirror in the restroom, her fingers trembling slightly as she buttoned her shirt. The scent of Shiraishi—a mix of peppermint and that heavy, musky heat—still clung to her skin like a second layer of clothing.

美悦子站在洗手间破裂的镜子前，指尖微颤着扣上衬衫。白石的味道——那种薄荷香气与浓烈、炽热的体味混合在一起，像第二层衣服一样紧紧贴在她的皮肤上。

She turned her head, catching a glimpse of the faint red mark on her collarbone. Instead of covering it with fear, she traced it with her thumb, a small, secret smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. It was a brand of his passion.

她转过头，瞥见锁骨上那道淡淡的红印。她没有惊恐地遮掩，反而用大拇指轻轻摩挲着，嘴角浮现出一抹隐秘的小憩。那是他热情的烙印。

Walking back to the classroom, the sun through the hallway windows felt exceptionally bright. When she entered, Shiraishi was already in his seat, spinning a pen with feigned boredom. But the moment their eyes met, the air between them seemed to ignite once more.

走回教室时，走廊窗户洒进的阳光显得格外明亮。她进门时，白石已经坐在座位上，装作无聊地转着笔。但当两人的目光交汇时，空气仿佛再次被点燃了。

He didn't say a word, but the intensity in his gaze told her everything. He was still thinking about the rhythm of her heartbeat against his chest and the way her voice had broken in that narrow stall.

他一言不发，但眼神中的炽热告诉了她一切。他还在回味她贴在他胸口的心跳频率，以及她在那个狭小隔间里支离破碎的声音。

During the English lecture, Miyetsuko felt a light kick against her chair. She looked down and saw Shiraishi’s sneaker nudging hers under the desk. It was a simple, playful touch, yet it carried the weight of the secret they had just shared.

英语课上，美悦子感觉到椅子被轻轻踢了一下。她低头看见白石的运动鞋在课桌下蹭着她的鞋尖。这是一个简单而俏皮的动作，却承载着他们刚刚分享的那个秘密的重量。

She reached down, pretending to drop her eraser, and for a fleeting second, her fingers brushed against his ankle. Shiraishi’s breath hitched, a sharp intake of air that only she could hear in the quiet room.

她弯下腰，假装弄掉了橡皮，在飞逝的一秒钟里，她的手指掠过他的脚踝。白石的呼吸一紧，在那安静的教室内，只有她能听到那声急促的吸气。

This was their world—a blend of mundane grammar exercises and a passion so fierce it threatened to melt the very floor beneath them.

这就是属于他们的世界——平庸的语法练习与一种如此猛烈、足以融化脚下地板的激情交织在一起。
