Chapter 3: The Leaking Vessel 

第三章：渗漏的容器

Part 1: The Face of a Drowned Goddess

溺水女神的面容

Saori’s beauty was a quiet catastrophe. It wasn't the aggressive glitter of the Lin family; it was the pale, transcendent glow of moonlight on deep water. Her skin possessed a translucent quality that seemed to bruise if a gaze held it too long, and her eyes were always slightly misted, as if she were mourning a world she didn't know how to refuse. She was a masterpiece of biological submission, a woman whose very bone structure seemed designed to yield.

沙织的美丽是一场安静的灾难。那不是林家那种侵略性的闪耀，而是深潭月光般苍白、超脱的光泽。她的肌肤透着一种近乎透明的质感，仿佛目光停留太久都会留下淤青；她的双眼总是带着轻微的迷离，像是正在为一个她不知该如何拒绝的世界而哀悼。她是生物性顺从的杰作，一个连骨架仿佛都为了妥协而生的女人。

To look at her was to want to possess her, and to ask her for anything was to receive it. Whether it was a billionaire like Kurosaki or the lowliest janitor at the academy, if they lowered their voice or grabbed her wrist, Saori would simply offer a faint, tragic smile and give them whatever they craved. She had no "no" in her vocabulary; she only had "yes" whispered through a haze of soft, compliant heat.

望向她便会生出占有的渴望，而向她索求任何东西都定能得到回应。无论是黑崎那样的亿万富翁，还是学院里最卑微的门房，只要他们压低声音或抓住她的手腕，沙织只会报以一丝淡淡的、悲剧性的微笑，然后交出他们渴望的一切。她的字典里没有“不”，只有在柔软、顺从的燥热中呢喃出的“好”。

Part 2: Under the Console

控制台下

Inside the van, Saori knelt in the footwell, her long hair falling to cover half her face. Her hands pressed against Makoto’s thighs as she lowered her head and took him in, her cheeks hollowing and bulging rhythmically. Makoto tilted his head back, his Adam’s apple sliding slowly, fingers threading into her hair and gently tightening. The wet, sucking sounds stood out sharply in the enclosed space of the van. Every now and then she lifted her eyes to glance at him quickly, then immediately looked down again.

车厢内，纱织跪在脚坑，长发垂落遮住半张脸。她双手按住诚的大腿，低头含住，腮帮子一下一下塌陷又鼓起。诚仰头，喉结缓慢滚动，手指插进她发丝里轻轻收紧。湿润的吮吸声在货车密闭的空间里格外清晰，她偶尔抬眼飞快看他，又立刻垂下。

Moments later, Makoto’s abdomen suddenly tensed, a low groan escaping him. A hot rush surged into her mouth; her throat tightened as she tried hard to swallow it all, but a thin, glistening thread of fluid still escaped from the corner of her lips and slid down her chin. Makoto exhaled heavily and released her hair, then casually used his thumb to smear the remaining slickness from himself across her face, leaving a wet streak along her cheek.

片刻后诚腰腹骤然绷紧，低哼一声。热流猛地涌进她嘴里，她喉咙收紧，努力全吞下去，嘴角还是溢出一丝细亮的黏液，顺着下巴滑落。诚喘着松开手，顺势用指腹把下体残留的粘液抹在她脸上，沿着脸颊划出一道湿痕。

Part 3: The Pulse of Betrayal

背叛的脉动

As the green line of Miyetsuko’s pulse spiked on the screen above, Saori’s moans became a frantic, rhythmic sobbing. Every time Makoto growled a command, forcing himself deeper against the back of her throat, she responded with a biological vibration that was more a gasp than a voice. In the heat of the friction, the secrets began to leak out of her like sweat. Her body was a perfect instrument, her skin slick and flushed from the raw intensity of his pace.

当上方屏幕里美悦子的脉搏绿线剧烈波动时，沙织的呻吟变成了促迫、富有节奏的啜泣。每当诚发出一声低沉的命令，强迫自己更深地抵入她的喉底，她都会产生一种生物性的震颤，那更像是喘息而非人声。在摩擦的燥热中，秘密像汗水一样从她身上渗出。她的身体是一件完美的乐器，肌肤因他狂暴的动作而变得湿滑、通红。

"The internal audits... they’re in the black safe," she gasped, her voice breaking as the contact became violent, the wet sound of flesh hitting flesh echoing in the cramped space. "I... I gave the combination to the auditor yesterday... because he asked so nicely... he promised it wouldn't hurt..."

“内部审计……在那个黑色保险箱里，”她喘息着，随着肉体撞击的湿腻声响在狭窄空间内回荡，她的声音变得破碎。“我……我昨天把密码给审计员了……因为他求我的样子很温柔……他说不会弄痛我的……”

Every man who entered her left a secret behind, and every man who came after took one away. She was the Lin family’s most fatal leak, not because she was evil, but because she was empty. She was a vessel that anyone could pour themselves into, and anyone could drink from.

每一个占有她的男人都会留下一个秘密，而每一个随后的男人又会带走一个。她是林家最致命的泄密口，不是因为她邪恶，而是因为她空虚。她是一个任何人都可以倾注自我，也任何人都可以从中啜饮的容器。

Part 4: The Residue of Utility

效用的残余

Makoto didn't look down at her again. To him, she was like a spent cigarette—still smoldering with a faint, ruined heat, but ultimately discarded. He adjusted the volume on the receiver, allowing the sound of Miyetsuko’s muffled sobs from the library to fill the cramped, dark van. It was a symphony of two ruins: the high-born swan weeping for her dignity, and the broken secretary breathing heavily against the floor, her body still slick with the evidence of his release.

诚没有再低头看她一眼。对他而言，她就像一支抽完的烟——虽还散发着微弱、颓丧的余温，但终究已被丢弃。他调大了接收器的音量，让美悦子从书房传来的压抑抽泣声充满了狭窄暗淡的车厢。这是一场关于两件废墟的交响乐：出身高贵的天鹅在为尊严哭泣，而破碎的秘书在冷硬的地板上沉重呼吸，身体上还沾着他发泄后的湿粘痕迹。

Saori made no move to fix her torn blouse or close her legs. She simply lay there in the mess of her own submission, a beautiful, hollow shell reflecting the blue light of the monitors. She was the ghost of a future that hadn't yet reached the girl on the screen—a map of every place the conquerors had already touched, tasted, and moved past. Outside, the rain began to fall, drumming against the metal roof of the van like the sound of a closing trap.

沙织没有试图整理被撕裂的衬衫，也没有合拢双腿。她只是静静地躺在自己那份狼藉的顺从里，像一个美丽而空洞的躯壳，映射着监视器幽蓝的光。她是那个尚未降临在屏幕女孩身上的未来幽灵——是一张记录着征服者们曾如何触碰、品尝并跨越每一个角落的地图。车窗外，雨开始落下，敲打在车厢金属顶棚上，听起来像陷阱扣合的声音。
