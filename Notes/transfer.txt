Under the Lighthouse Reunion Pact

By the seaside lighthouse, two old friends, Leo and Sarah, made a promise to reunite after decades apart. Life had taken them in different directions, but they vowed to meet again. Years passed, and the lighthouse stood as a steadfast witness to their pledge. Finally, the day arrived. Leo, with a heart full of anticipation, waited at the base of the lighthouse. Sarah, her steps slow but determined, walked towards him. Embracing, they laughed and cried, their friendship as enduring as the lighthouse that brought them back together.
