The Woman in the Elevator

She hated this hotel.

Not for any dramatic reason. It was just inconvenient—too far from the bus stop, the hallway lights too dim, the elevator too slow. But it was cheap, and cheap mattered more this month.

She balanced two grocery bags in her arms as she waited for the elevator. The plastic handles cut into her fingers. Soup containers, bread, instant noodles. Dinner for tonight and tomorrow, if she was careful.

When the elevator arrived, a man stepped in behind her, pulling a suitcase. Business type, she guessed. Clean jacket, tired eyes. They nodded, the kind people did when they didn’t want to talk.

Sixth floor.

The elevator hummed upward, then shuddered slightly between floors. She tightened her grip on the bags, suddenly aware of how small the space felt. The man smelled faintly of soap and airport air.

She wondered, briefly, what he was here for. Meetings? An affair? A funeral? Hotels made everyone look the same—temporary, half-erased.

When the doors opened, he stepped out first. She followed, walking slower, her arms aching now. He turned left. She turned right.

Her room was near the end of the hall.

Inside, she set the groceries on the desk and sat on the bed without taking off her coat. The room was quiet in a way that felt borrowed. She took out her phone, checked a message she’d already read twice.

Did you talk to him yet?

She didn’t reply.

She heated the soup in the microwave downstairs later, standing alone in the small laundry room, scrolling through photos she hadn’t deleted. At some point, raised voices echoed through the wall—someone arguing in another room. She froze, spoon in hand, listening. It sounded familiar. Too familiar.

Back in her room, she ate slowly, sitting on the edge of the bed. The soup was too salty. She drank water straight from the bottle to fix it.

That night, she slept poorly. Dreams came in pieces—elevators that didn’t stop, bags that tore open, people speaking without sound.

In the morning, she packed early. She passed the elevator again, empty this time, and took the stairs instead. Her arms were free now. That felt good.

Outside, the parking lot was nearly full. A man struggled with a suitcase near a car, muttering under his breath. She walked past without looking at his face.

The hotel shrank behind her as she headed for the bus stop.

Just another place, she told herself.
Just another night.
