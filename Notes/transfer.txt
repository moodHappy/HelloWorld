Chapter 14: The Cracked Defense

第十四章：碎裂的防线

Part 1: The Victor's Return

胜利者的回归

Mr. Lin entered the mansion like a conquering hero. He didn't even take off his coat before calling for Miyetsuko. His face was flushed with the triumph of the Ginza meeting.

林先生像个凯旋的英雄一样走进大宅。还没顾上脱掉大衣，他就大声传唤美悦子。他的脸上满是银座会面后的得意之色。

"It’s done, Miyetsuko! The Bai-Feng Fund is in," he declared, pouring himself a victory drink. "We have the capital. The Lin name is safe. I told you I would handle it."

“成功了，美悦子！白凤基金入场了，”他宣告着，为自己倒了一杯庆功酒。“我们拿到资金了。林家的名声保住了。我告诉过你我会处理好的。”

Miyetsuko stood by the staircase, watching the man she used to idolize. He looked smaller now, his joy built on a foundation of hidden blood. "At what cost, Father?" she asked quietly.

美悦子站在楼梯旁，看着这个她曾崇拜过的男人。他现在看起来渺小了许多，他的喜悦建立在隐秘的血泪之上。“代价是什么，父亲？”她轻声问道。

Part 2: The Suitcase

行李箱

She didn't wait for his answer. She walked to the servants' wing and found Saori’s door ajar. Inside, the secretary was methodically folding a silk nightgown into a small leather suitcase.

她没等他回答，径直走向佣人房，发现沙织的房门虚掩着。房间里，秘书正有条不紊地将一件丝绸睡衣折好放入小皮箱中。

"Where are you going?" Miyetsuko demanded, her heart hammering against her ribs.

“你要去哪儿？”美悦子问道，心跳剧烈地撞击着肋骨。

Saori didn't look up. Her movements were robotic, efficient. "A working weekend at a mountain retreat, Miyetsuko-sama. To finalize the Bai-Feng contracts. Your father requires it."

沙织没有抬头，动作机械而干练。“去山间别墅度过一个工作周末，美悦子大人。为了敲定白凤基金的合同。这是你父亲的要求。”

Part 3: The Revolting Truth

令人作呕的真相

"A working weekend? With those men?" Miyetsuko grabbed Saori’s wrist, stopping her. "I saw the marks on your neck, Saori. I’m not a child anymore. He’s sending you there to be... used."

“工作周末？和那些男人一起？”美悦子抓住沙织的手腕，拦住了她。“我看到你脖子上的伤痕了，沙织。我不再是小孩子了。他送你去那里是为了……被利用。”

Saori finally looked up. Her eyes were as calm as a frozen lake. She offered that faint, tragic smile that made Miyetsuko want to scream. "In this house, everyone has a function. Yours is to be the pure swan. Mine is to ensure the cage remains gilded."

沙织终于抬起了头，眼神平静得像一潭冰湖。她露出了那抹让美悦子想放声尖叫的、淡淡的、悲剧性的微笑。“在这栋房子里，每个人都有自己的功能。你的功能是做一只纯洁的天鹅，而我的功能是确保这个笼子依然金碧辉煌。”

Miyetsuko let go as if she had been burned. The realization was a physical weight. The "Last Line of Defense" wasn't a wall; it was a pedestal built on Saori’s broken body.

美悦子像是被烫到一样松开了手。这个领悟如同一块沉重的巨石。所谓的“最后防线”根本不是一堵墙，而是一个建立在沙织破碎身体上的基座。

Part 4: The Puppet Master's Pivot

织网者的转向

In the black van, Makoto watched the feed from the bedroom camera. He saw Miyetsuko’s distress and Saori’s numbing acceptance. He checked a file on the Bai-Feng investors—men with appetites far more violent than Kurosaki's.

黑色厢式车内，诚注视着卧室监控传来的画面。他看到了美悦子的痛苦和沙织那令人麻木的顺从。他查阅了一份关于白凤投资者的文件——那些人的欲望比黑崎还要暴虐得多。

He picked up a secondary phone and dialed a number. "The Bai-Feng rescue is moving forward. They’re taking the secretary to the Hakone retreat tonight."

他拿起第二部手机拨通了一个号码。“白凤的救助计划正在推进。他们今晚要带秘书去箱根的别墅。”

A cold smile touched his lips. "Inform the tax authorities. If Bai-Feng is making an illegal injection, it’s only fair that we burn the bridge before they cross it. I want the swan to watch her last hope turn to ash."

一抹冷笑浮现在他的唇角。“通知税务部门。如果白凤要进行非法注资，那么在他们过桥之前拆掉桥才是公平的。我要让天鹅亲眼看着她最后的希望化为灰烬。”
