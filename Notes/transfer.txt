# The Last Library of Dreams

In a world where dreams were becoming extinct, Elara guarded the Last Library of Dreams. Each night, she carefully cataloged the fading visions that visitors brought in jars.

One evening, a child arrived with nothing but an empty jar. "I've forgotten how to dream," she whispered. Elara smiled, opening a book filled with starlight. "Dreams aren't lost," she said, sprinkling glitter into the jar. "They're just waiting to be remembered." As the child's eyes widened with wonder, new dreams began to bloom across the land, one shimmering thought at a time.
