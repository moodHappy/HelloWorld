# The Storyteller's Mask  

Old Chen wore his carved wooden mask every evening in the town square.  
<i>老陈每天傍晚都会在镇广场戴上他雕刻精美的木制面具。</i>  

Behind the smiling face, he transformed into heroes, villains, and lovers, captivating the crowd with tales of ancient China.  
<i>在那张微笑的面具背后，他化身为英雄、反派和恋人，用古老中国的故事吸引着人群。</i>  

Children believed the mask held magic, but only Chen knew its truth.  
<i>孩子们相信面具有魔力，但只有陈自己知道真相。</i>  

The mask freed him from his timid self, allowing his voice to boom with confidence.  
<i>面具让他摆脱了内向羞怯的自己，使他的声音充满自信地回荡。</i>  

When stories ended, he carefully removed the mask, returning to his quiet existence.  
<i>当故事讲完，他小心地取下面具，回归平静的生活。</i>  

One evening, a young girl asked why he always covered his face.  
<i>一天傍晚，一个小女孩问他为什么总是遮住脸。</i>  

Chen smiled gently. "The mask doesn't hide me," he whispered. "It reveals who I truly am."  
<i>陈轻轻一笑，低声说道：“面具不是掩饰我，它揭示了真正的我。”</i>
