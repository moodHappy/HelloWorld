Chapter 29: The Queen's High Heels

第二十九章：女王的高跟鞋

The Russian stared at Chen Mo, then at the tablet. He was a businessman. He knew when he was outmatched.

俄罗斯人盯着陈默，又看了看平板。他是个生意人。他知道什么时候该认输。

"I offer 10% of the Santos district," Nikolai said.

“我出桑托斯区10%的地盘，”尼古拉说。

"20%," Miyetsuko countered, tapping the screen. "And exclusive rights to your shipping routes."

“20%，”美悦子反击，敲击屏幕。“还有你航运路线的独家使用权。”

"Deal."

“成交。”

Tap.

嗒。

"Container 778. Cleared," the automated voice announced.

“778号集装箱。已放行，”自动语音播报。

Simultaneously, phones started ringing in the pockets of the Colombian bodyguards.

与此同时，哥伦比亚保镖口袋里的电话开始响了。

"Boss! The Feds! They are raiding the shipment! They are burning the coke!"

“老大！联邦警察！他们在查抄货物！他们在烧毁可卡因！”

The Butcher, sweating and clutching his broken finger, looked at Miyetsuko with pure hatred.

屠夫流着汗，捂着断指，用纯粹的仇恨看着美悦子。

"You... you destroyed me..."

“你……你毁了我……”

Miyetsuko stood up from the armrest. She smoothed her Qipao over her hips.

美悦子从扶手上站起来。抚平臀部的旗袍。

She walked over to The Butcher. She lifted her foot—shod in a sharp, black stiletto heel.

她走到屠夫面前。抬起脚——穿着尖锐的黑色细高跟鞋。

She placed the heel gently on the table, right next to his broken hand. Then, she leaned in, her perfume—jasmine and gunpowder—enveloping him.

她把鞋跟轻轻放在桌上，就在他断手旁边。然后，她凑近，她的香水味——茉莉花和火药味——笼罩了他。

"I didn't destroy you. I educated you," she whispered. "Next time, don't point your finger at a Queen."

“我没毁了你。我是在教育你，”她低语。“下次，别用手指挥着女王。”

She turned to Fantasma, who was watching with a mix of fear and delight.

她转向幽灵，后者正带着恐惧和喜悦看着这一切。

"Dinner was lovely, Fantasma. But the meat was a bit... tough."

“晚餐很愉快，幽灵。但这肉有点……老了。”

She grabbed Chen Mo's arm.

她挽住陈默的手臂。

"Let's go, Chen. I'm bored. And you promised to show me the view from the favela roof."

“走吧，陈。我无聊了。而且你答应带我去看贫民窟屋顶的风景。”
