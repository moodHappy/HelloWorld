Emma heard colors. Blue sounded like ocean waves, green like rustling leaves, and red like distant trumpets. When she walked through the farmer's market, it was a symphony of produce. The oranges sang with citrusy high notes, bananas performed mellow yellow tones, and apples created crisp red harmonies. Most people thought she was strange, but Emma lived in a richer world than they could imagine. One rainy Tuesday, she met a painter who listened to music and saw colors. When they held hands, the world exploded in a chromatic orchestration neither had ever experienced before.
