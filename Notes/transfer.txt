Chapter 25: The Phantom's Call
第二十五章：幽灵的来电
Kurosaki Heavy Industries. President's Office.
黑崎重工。社长办公室。
The atmosphere was suffocating. Kurosaki Soichiro stared at his tablet. His hands, usually steady enough to sign billion-dollar contracts, were trembling slightly.
气氛令人窒息。黑崎宗一郎死死盯着平板电脑。他那双签惯了百亿合同的手，竟然在微微颤抖。
On the screen was a photo.
It was artistic, black and white. A man's hand gripping a woman's waist tightly, leaving deep indentations in the soft flesh. The woman's face was turned away, but the mole on her neck and the diamond ring on her finger were unmistakably his wife's.
And in the corner of the photo, placed deliberately on the bedside table, was a USB drive. A silver USB drive stained with blood.
屏幕上是一张照片。
那是艺术般的黑白照。一只男人的手紧紧抓着女人的腰，在软肉上留下了深深的指印。女人的脸侧过去，但脖子上的那颗痣和手指上的钻戒，无可辩驳地属于他的妻子。
而在照片的角落，特意放在床头柜上的，是一个U盘。一个沾着血的银色U盘。
The message attached was simple:
“The purge failed. The ghost is back. - 1024”
附带的信息很简单：
“清洗失败。幽灵回来了。——1024”
"Impossible..." Kurosaki smashed the tablet on the floor. "The system log confirmed the deletion!"
“不可能……”黑崎把平板电脑砸在地上。“系统日志确认删除了！”
At that moment, the red secure phone on his desk rang. It was Minister Tanaka.
就在这时，桌上的红色保密电话响了。是田中大臣。
Kurosaki picked it up. "Minister, I..."
黑崎接起电话。“大臣，我……”
"Kurosaki! Are you insane?" Tanaka's roar came from the other end. "How dare you send that ledger to my private email? Are you threatening me? If I go down, I'm taking your whole company with me!"
“黑崎！你疯了吗？”田中的咆哮声从对面传来。“你竟敢把那本账簿发到我的私人邮箱？你在威胁我？如果我倒了，我会拉着你的整个公司陪葬！”
Click. The line went dead.
咔哒。 电话挂断。
Kurosaki stood frozen. He realized what had happened. He had been played. The "adultery" was a cover. The "purge" was a theft. And now, his wife was dismantling his empire brick by brick from the shadows.
黑崎僵在原地。他意识到发生了什么。他被耍了。“偷情”是掩护。“清洗”是盗窃。而现在，他的妻子正在阴影里，一块砖一块砖地拆掉他的帝国。
He sat down heavily in his chair, pressing the intercom.
他重重地坐回椅子里，按下对讲机。
"Activate the 'Cleanup Crew'. Level 1 authorization."
“启动‘清道夫’小组。一级授权。”
"Target, sir?"
“目标是谁，先生？”
"My wife. And that man." Kurosaki's voice was devoid of any emotion. "Bring me their heads. And the drive."
“我的妻子。还有那个男人。”黑崎的声音没有任何感情。“把他们的头带回来。还有那个U盘。”
Chapter 26: The Wolf at the Door
第二十六章：门口的狼
Back in the safe house.
回到安全屋。
Chen Mo closed the laptop. "The bait is taken. I intercepted an encrypted signal from Kurosaki's HQ. He contacted the 'Cleanup Crew'."
陈默合上电脑。“鱼上钩了。我截获了黑崎总部的加密信号。他联系了‘清道夫’。”
"Good. He's panicking. When a man panics, he makes mistakes." Miyetsuko was buttoning her shirt—well, attempting to button the shirt that was too tight for her chest.
“很好。他慌了。男人一慌，就会犯错。”美悦子正在扣扣子——或者说，试图扣上那件对她胸部来说太紧的衬衫。
Suddenly, Chen Mo's expression changed. He put a finger to his lips.
突然，陈默脸色一变。他竖起手指放在嘴边。
"Shh."
“嘘。”
He pointed to the door.
他指了指门口。
On the monitor of the hidden camera in the hallway, three men dressed as gas maintenance workers were approaching their door. They carried heavy toolboxes. The way they walked—steady, silent, tactical formation—screamed "assassins."
在走廊隐蔽摄像头的监控器上，三个穿着煤气维修工制服的男人正走向他们的房门。他们提着沉重的工具箱。那种走路的方式——稳健、无声、战术队形——都在尖叫着“杀手”二字。
"They found us fast," Miyetsuko whispered, grabbing a pistol from under the sofa cushion. Her eyes weren't fearful, but excited.
“他们找得真快。”美悦子低声说，从沙发垫下摸出一把手枪。她的眼神没有恐惧，只有兴奋。
"This is one of his properties. He knows the layout." Chen Mo picked up the fruit knife again. "We have to leave. Now."
“这也是他的房产之一。他知道布局。”陈默再次拿起了水果刀。“我们得走。立刻。”
"The back window leads to the fire escape," Miyetsuko kicked off her heels, standing barefoot on the cold floor. "But we need a diversion."
“后窗通向防火梯。”美悦子踢掉高跟鞋，赤脚站在冰冷的地板上。“但我们需要一个诱饵。”
She looked at the bottle of expensive whiskey on the table, then at the microwave oven.
她看了看桌上那瓶昂贵的威士忌，又看了看微波炉。
"Chen, do you know how to make a Molotov cocktail in 10 seconds?"
“陈，你知道怎么在10秒内做一个莫洛托夫鸡尾酒吗？”
Chen Mo smiled. It was a feral smile.
陈默笑了。那是野性的笑容。
"Honey, I'm a chemist when I'm not coding."
“亲爱的，我不写代码的时候是个化学家。”
