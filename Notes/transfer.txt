当然。下面是一篇英文短篇对话微小说，情节清晰、不抽象，完全由对话推进：

“Last Train”

“Is this seat taken?”
“No. Sit.”

“Long day?”
“Long life.”

The train jolted forward. Outside, the city slid past in broken lights.

“You always answer like that?”
“Only when I don’t feel like lying.”

She smiled. “Where are you getting off?”
“End of the line.”
“Everyone says that.”
“Most people don’t mean it.”

Silence settled between them.

“You look tired,” she said.
“So do you.”
“I’m running away.”
“From what?”
“From someone who used to know me.”
“Did it work?”
“Not yet.”

The train slowed.

“This is me,” she said, standing. “You?”
He stayed seated. “I told you.”

She hesitated. “Will you be okay?”
“I’ve been worse.”

The doors closed.

As the train pulled away, he whispered to no one,
“Next time, I’ll get off earlier.”
