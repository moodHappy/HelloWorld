I knew her since we were kids, always been best friends. People kept asking if we were more, but nah, we were just buddies who shared everything.

Then one night, after too many drinks, something happened. Next morning was awkward. Do we pretend it never happened? Can we go back to being just friends?

Now she's dating someone else, and I'm trying to be happy for her. But sometimes I catch myself wondering what if. Funny how love can sneak up on you when you're not looking. And even funnier how one night can change everything between two people who thought they knew each other.
