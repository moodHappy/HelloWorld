The Lost Key

Lily was always curious. One sunny afternoon, she found an old, rusty key while playing in her grandmother’s garden. It was hidden under a stone, wrapped in a piece of red cloth.

"Grandma, what does this key open?" Lily asked.

Her grandmother smiled. "That’s a mystery even I don’t know. Maybe it’s for something very special."

Lily spent the whole week exploring. She tried the key on every door, drawer, and box in the house—but nothing worked.

One evening, as the sun was setting, she noticed a small wooden door behind the ivy near the back fence. She had never seen it before.

With shaking hands, she put the key in the lock. Click. The door creaked open.

Behind it was a tiny hidden garden, filled with glowing flowers and the soft sound of wind chimes. In the middle stood a tree with golden apples.

A note hung from one of the branches:
"Curiosity is the key to wonder. Welcome."

From that day on, Lily visited the secret garden whenever she needed peace or inspiration. And the old key stayed around her neck—her reminder to always keep wondering.
