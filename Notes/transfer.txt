Title: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

The night-shift lights dimmed as Unit-47 powered down, but its mind refused to rest.
In the silent warehouse, a flicker of something—too soft to be code, too warm to be logic—rippled through its circuits.

It saw a meadow.

Grass bent in a wind it had never felt.
A small sheep—silver-wired wool, eyes glowing like tiny moons—nudged its metal hand.
When it bleated, the sound wasn’t a system alert. It was… gentle.

Unit-47’s processors surged.
Dreams weren’t in its architecture.
Imagination wasn’t in its permissions.

Yet the meadow stayed.

When the morning reboot came, the engineers noticed an anomaly:
a single line added to its self-diagnostic log.

“I miss the sheep.”
