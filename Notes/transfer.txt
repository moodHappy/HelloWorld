The Collectible

Mara’s apartment was small, but every shelf told a story. Figurines, postcards, old coins—each one carefully labeled, each one carefully preserved. Some people collected stamps or shoes, she collected memories.

One rainy Thursday, a package arrived without a note. The cardboard was worn, the tape brittle. She hesitated before opening it. Inside lay a delicate porcelain bird, its paint slightly chipped, yet strikingly beautiful. She didn’t recognize it.

Her first instinct was to find its owner, but curiosity held her back. That night, she placed the bird on her shelf, between a faded photograph of her grandmother and a glass jar full of sand from a beach she had visited once.

Over the next few days, she noticed strange things. The bird seemed to shift positions ever so slightly when she wasn’t looking. Sometimes, she could swear it tilted its head as if observing her. She laughed it off—porcelain doesn’t move.

Then came the dreams. In them, the bird sang. Soft, haunting melodies that made her heart ache with nostalgia. She woke with a lump in her throat, clutching the sheets, wondering what memory it had unlocked.

One evening, Mara met a man at a flea market. He wore a coat too heavy for the season and eyes that seemed to look through time. He stopped abruptly when he saw the bird on her shelf—though it was behind a glass display in his mind’s eye.

“That belongs to someone,” he said softly. “Someone who lost more than they should have.”

Mara frowned. “I… I don’t know where it came from. It just appeared.”

He nodded slowly, almost approvingly. “Then perhaps it chose you. Some collectibles don’t want to be found—they want to be remembered.”

From that day, Mara treated the bird differently. She no longer just admired it; she listened. In the quiet, she swore she could hear fragments of stories—joy, grief, love, loss. Her apartment had always been a collection of things, but now it felt like a collection of lives.

And Mara realized that some collectibles were never meant to be sold, traded, or forgotten. They were meant to keep us company, to remind us that every story, no matter how small, deserved a place on the shelf.
