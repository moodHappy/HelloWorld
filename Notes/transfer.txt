Chapter 34: The Butcher's New Knife

第三十四章：屠夫的新刀

A meat packing plant in the North Zone of Rio. Carcasses of cattle hung from hooks, sliding slowly along the ceiling rails. The air was freezing and smelled of raw iron.

里约北区的一家肉类加工厂。牛的尸体挂在钩子上，沿着天花板的轨道缓慢滑动。空气冰冷，弥漫着生铁的味道。

"The Butcher" sat on a crate, nursing his broken finger which was now splinted with metal.

“屠夫”坐在一只板条箱上，护理着他那根现在被打上金属夹板的断指。

A man in a sharp grey suit walked in. He didn't look like a gangster. He looked like a corporate lawyer from Tokyo. He held a briefcase.

一个穿着利落灰色西装的男人走了进来。他看起来不像黑帮。他看起来像个来自东京的企业律师。他提着一个公文包。

"Mr. Mishima sends his regards," the lawyer placed the briefcase on a table covered in pig fat. He opened it. It wasn't cash. It was bearer bonds and a satellite phone. "And he sends... resources."

“三岛先生向您问好，”律师把公文包放在满是猪油的桌子上。打开。里面不是现金。是不记名债券和一部卫星电话。“他还送来了……资源。”

"I don't need money," The Butcher spat. "I need that bitch's head. And the man who broke my finger."

“我不需要钱，”屠夫啐了一口。“我要那个婊子的头。还有那个折断我手指的男人。”

"You will get them," the lawyer smiled thinly. "Mishima-san has purchased the 'exclusive rights' to their lives. Fantasma has been paid to... look the other way. The port is closed to them. The streets are closed. They are rats in a burning box."

“你会得到的，”律师露出淡薄的笑。“三岛先生已经购买了他们生命的‘独家版权’。幽灵已经收了钱……会对一切视而不见。港口对他们关闭了。街道也封锁了。他们就是燃烧盒子里的老鼠。”

The Butcher stood up, grabbing a meat cleaver. He tested the edge with his thumb.

屠夫站起来，抓起一把切肉刀。用拇指试了试刀锋。

"Tonight, I carve. First the man. Then the woman. Slowly."

“今晚，我要动刀了。先杀男的。再杀女的。慢慢来。”
