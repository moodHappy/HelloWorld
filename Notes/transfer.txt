It was a rainy afternoon. Tom looked out of the window and sighed. The streets were wet, and the sky was gray. He had planned to go cycling, but now he had to stay indoors.
He decided to make the best of it. He brewed a cup of tea and sat by the window with a book. The sound of raindrops tapping on the glass was surprisingly relaxing. He felt peaceful, even though he was stuck at home.
After reading for a while, Tom called his friend Anna. They talked about their favorite movies and shared some funny stories. Time flew quickly, and before he knew it, the rain had stopped. Tom smiled and thought, “Even a rainy day can be enjoyable if you make it so.”
