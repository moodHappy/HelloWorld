Chapter 3: Sake in the Rainy Night

第三章：雨夜的清酒

Maybe because they were both “escapees,” they ended up sitting on the long bench in the lounge.

不知是不是因为同样是“逃离者”的缘故，两人在休息区的长榻上坐了下来。

The woman introduced herself as Lin, five years older than Chen Mo.

女人自称姓林，比陈默大五岁。

“You’re here alone too?” Lin swirled a can of lightly fermented plum wine, tilting slightly to look at him. Her yukata hem shifted just enough to reveal half of her smooth, toned calf.

“你也是一个人？”林女士手里晃着一罐微醺梅酒，侧过身看着陈默。这个姿势让她的浴衣下摆微微错开，露出半截光洁紧致的小腿。

“Yes, work’s been exhausting. I wanted somewhere no one knew me, a place to hide,” Chen Mo said, taking a sip of his milk. A faint scent drifted from her—shower gel mixed with her natural, creamy aroma—stirring his mind unexpectedly.

“嗯，工作太累了，想找个没人认识的地方躲躲。”陈默喝了一口牛奶，鼻尖若有若无地飘来一阵香气，那是沐浴露混合着她身上特有的乳香味，让人有些心猿意马。

“I feel the same,” Lin sighed, her gaze slightly glazed. “My husband is busy with business, the kids with tutoring. At home, I’m like a robot that just sweeps and operates. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror….”

“我也一样。”林女士叹了口气，眼神变得有些迷离，“丈夫忙着生意，孩子忙着补习。我在那个家里，就像个只会运转的扫地机器人。有时候照镜子，看着自己的身体……”

She glanced down at her voluptuous figure, smiling wryly, her fingers tracing the edge of the can. “Still a living body, yet I feel withered. So I bought a ticket and left, told no one.”

她低头看了一眼自己丰腴的身段，自嘲地笑了笑，手指轻轻划过易拉罐边缘：“明明还是一具鲜活的身体，却感觉已经枯萎了。所以我就买了一张票，谁也没告诉，一个人跑出来了。”

The rain outside fell harder, striking the tiles with crisp, clear sounds. The air inside felt thick, almost sticky.

外面的雨越下越大，敲打在瓦片上，发出清脆的声响。室内的空气仿佛凝固了，变得有些粘稠。

“You’re not withered,” Chen Mo said impulsively, his voice dry. “You… are beautiful.”

“你并不枯萎。”陈默鬼使神差地接了一句，声音有些干涩，“你……很美。”

His words were slightly improper, but in this secluded rainy night, they somehow fit.

这话有些冒犯，但在这个与世隔绝的雨夜，似乎又恰如其分。

Lin froze for a moment, then turned her gaze to him, eyes deep with surprise and a hidden pleasure. She leaned slightly forward, and the loose neckline of her yukata fell further, letting Chen Mo feel the warmth radiating from her body.

林女士愣了一下，随即转过头，深深地看了陈默一眼。她的眼神里没有被冒犯的怒意，反倒有一丝惊讶和某种隐秘的喜悦。她微微前倾身体，那宽松的领口随之垂落，陈默甚至能感觉到她身上散发出的热力。

“Is that so?” she whispered, her eyes wet, “At home, no one has complimented me like that in a long time.”

“是吗？”她轻声反问，眼神变得湿漉漉的，“在那个家里，已经很久没人这么夸过我了。”

She tapped the rim of her can against Chen Mo’s milk bottle.

她拿起酒罐，轻轻碰了碰陈默手里的牛奶瓶。

The instant their fingers touched, Chen Mo felt her hand cold yet impossibly soft. A thrill, mixed with the sound of rain, surged in his chest.

指尖相触的瞬间，陈默感觉到她的手指冰凉，却又柔软得不可思议。一种从未有过的悸动，混合着窗外的雨声，在他的胸腔里疯狂滋长。

“This rain looks like it’s going to last all night,” she said, looking out the window, her tone carrying a subtle, suggestive meaning. “I wonder how well the inn’s soundproofing works.”

“这雨好像还要下一整夜呢。”她看向窗外，语气里带着一丝意味深长的暗示，“不知道这旅馆的隔音好不好。”

Chen Mo’s heartbeat skipped. He looked at this mature, voluptuous woman, with a hint of melancholy and danger. On this rain-soaked night, far from the city’s noise, he knew some stories were only just beginning.

陈默的心跳漏了一拍。他看着眼前这位成熟、丰满、带着一点点忧郁和危险气息的人妻，在这个远离都市喧嚣的雨夜，他知道，有些故事，可能才刚刚开始。
