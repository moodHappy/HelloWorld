The next morning, Tom woke up on time.

That already felt like a small victory.

He lay in bed for a moment, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet.

No alarms. No rushing. Just breathing.

He made coffee at home this time.

It wasn’t great, but it was warm.

While drinking it, he checked his phone.

No new messages. No urgent news.

That was fine.

On the way to work, the bus wasn’t as crowded.

He found a seat by the window and watched the streets pass by.

A kid laughed somewhere behind him. Someone hummed softly.

At work, his charger was right where he’d left it.

His computer started without complaining.

He finished his tasks slowly, one by one.

Nothing exciting happened.

And somehow, that felt nice.

At lunch, he ate alone and didn’t mind it.

He scrolled through old photos, smiled at a few, ignored the rest.

In the afternoon, it rained.

Tom forgot his umbrella and got a little wet.

But the air smelled clean, and the city looked softer.

That night, he cooked eggs instead of noodles.

They stuck to the pan, but he ate them anyway.

Before bed, he messaged his mom.

“I’m okay today.”

She replied a minute later.

“That’s good.”

Tom put his phone down and turned off the light.

Another normal day.

And tomorrow would probably be the same.

He closed his eyes.

That was enough.
