Chapter 25: The Queen's Licking

第二十五章：女王的舔舐

The villa was quiet. The kind of silence that only exists after a deafening explosion.

别墅很安静。那种只有在震耳欲聋的爆炸之后才会存在的寂静。

Chen Mo sat on the edge of the marble bathtub. He was shirtless. The black shirt, stiff with dried blood and sweat, lay in a heap on the floor. His left arm had a long, shallow gash where the bullet had grazed him—an ugly red line across his muscle.

陈默坐在大理石浴缸的边缘。他赤裸着上身。那件因干涸的血迹和汗水而变硬的黑衬衫被扔在地板上。他的左臂上有一道长长的浅伤口，那是子弹擦过的地方——一道横跨肌肉的丑陋红线。

"Sit still," Miyetsuko whispered.

“坐好别动，”美悦子低声说。

She wasn't wearing the ruined white suit anymore. She was naked, her body glowing softly in the warm yellow light of the bathroom. She held a bottle of antiseptic and a cotton pad, kneeling between Chen Mo's spread legs.

她不再穿那件毁坏的白西装了。她赤裸着，身体在浴室温暖的黄光下柔和地发光。她拿着一瓶消毒水和棉片，跪在陈默张开的双腿之间。

The posture was submissive, but her aura was anything but. She was a priestess tending to her sacred altar.

这个姿势是顺从的，但她的气场绝非如此。她像是一个正在照料她神圣祭坛的女祭司。

"It might sting," she dabbed the alcohol onto the wound.

“可能会有点疼，”她把酒精轻拍在伤口上。

Chen Mo hissed, his abdominal muscles contracting involuntarily. His hand instinctively gripped her shoulder, fingers digging into her soft skin.

陈默嘶了一声，腹肌不由自主地收缩。他的手本能地抓住了她的肩膀，手指陷入她柔软的皮肤里。

"Pain means you are alive, Chen," she blew gently on the wound, her cool breath soothing the burning sensation. "You bled for me today. Again."

“痛意味着你还活着，陈，”她轻轻对着伤口吹气，凉爽的气息安抚着灼烧感。“你今天为我流血了。又一次。”

"I'd do it again," Chen Mo looked down at her. Her hair was loose, falling like a black curtain over his thighs. Her eyes, usually sharp and predatory, were now filled with a pool of water—tenderness, gratitude, and a deep, heavy desire.

“我会再做一次的，”陈默低头看着她。她的头发散开了，像黑色的幕布一样垂在他的大腿上。她那双通常锐利、充满掠夺性的眼睛，此刻却蓄满了一汪水——那是温柔、感激，和一种深沉厚重的欲望。

"I know," she dropped the cotton pad.

“我知道，”她扔掉了棉片。

She leaned forward. Instead of bandaging the wound, she extended her tongue.

她向前倾身。没有包扎伤口，而是伸出了舌头。

It was a slow, deliberate movement. Her pink, wet tongue touched the edge of the angry red gash. She tasted the metallic tang of his blood, the salt of his sweat, the grit of the battle.

那是一个缓慢、刻意的动作。她粉红、湿润的舌头触碰到了那道愤怒红痕的边缘。她尝到了他血液的铁锈味，汗水的咸味，还有战斗的沙砾感。

"Miyetsuko..." Chen Mo's breath hitched.

“美悦子……”陈默的呼吸停滞了。

She licked the wound, cleaning it with a primitive, animalistic devotion. It was the way a lioness heals her mate. It was intimate, raw, and incredibly erotic.

她舔舐着伤口，用一种原始的、动物般的虔诚清理着它。那是母狮治愈伴侣的方式。亲密、原始，而且色情得不可思议。

"Your blood tastes like iron and fire," she murmured against his skin, her lips brushing the wound. "It tastes like... loyalty."

“你的血尝起来像铁和火，”她贴着他的皮肤呢喃，嘴唇擦过伤口。“尝起来像……忠诚。”

Then, she moved lower.

然后，她向下移动。

Her hands slid up his thighs, caressing the tense muscles. Her face moved away from his arm, trailing kisses down his chest, over his abs, stopping right in front of his groin.

她的手顺着他的大腿向上滑，抚摸着紧绷的肌肉。她的脸离开了他的手臂，一路吻过他的胸膛，越过腹肌，停在了他的腹股沟前。

"You served me in the warehouse," she looked up at him, her eyes locking onto his. "You were my shield. My brain. My ghost."

“你在仓库里侍奉了我，”她抬头看着他，眼神锁住他的。“你是我的盾。我的大脑。我的幽灵。”

She gently pulled down his boxer briefs.

她轻轻拉下了他的平角裤。

"Now... let the Queen serve you."

“现在……让女王来侍奉你。”

The air in the bathroom became thick and heavy.

浴室里的空气变得粘稠厚重。

She didn't rush. This wasn't the frantic, adrenaline-fueled sex on the boat. This was slow. This was worship.

她没有急躁。这不是船上那种疯狂的、肾上腺素驱动的性爱。这是缓慢的。这是崇拜。

She took him into her mouth.

她含住了他。

"Oh..." Chen Mo threw his head back, his hands gripping her hair, not pulling, but holding on for dear life.

“噢……”陈默仰起头，双手抓进她的头发里，不是拉扯，而是像抓住救命稻草一样紧紧抓着。

It was warm. So incredibly warm.

很温暖。难以置信的温暖。

Her mouth was a sanctuary. She used her tongue with the same precision she used to command an empire. Every swirl, every suction, every depth was calculated to extract pleasure, to drain the tension from his body.

她的嘴是一个避难所。她运用舌头的精准度，就像她指挥一个帝国一样。每一次旋转，每一次吸吮，每一次深入，都是经过计算的，为了提取快感，为了抽走他身体里的紧张。

She hummed against him, the vibration traveling straight to his spine. She looked up occasionally, watching his face unravel, watching the stoic, cold-blooded analyst lose control because of her.

她贴着他发出哼鸣，震动直达他的脊椎。她偶尔抬眼，看着他的表情崩塌，看着那个坚忍、冷血的分析师因为她而失控。

"Is this good, my Knight?" she pulled back slightly, a string of saliva connecting them. Her lips were red and swollen, her expression one of utter devotion.

“舒服吗，我的骑士？”她稍微退开一点，一道银丝连接着他们。她的嘴唇红肿，表情是全然的奉献。

"You are... dangerous," Chen Mo gasped, his voice trembling.

“你真……危险，”陈默喘息着，声音颤抖。

"Only to others," she smiled, and went back down, deeper this time.

“只对别人危险，”她笑了，然后再次俯身，这一次更深。

The water in the tub was cooling, but the heat between them was enough to boil the ocean. In this small, tiled room, with the scent of antiseptic and sex, Chen Mo realized that he wasn't just her partner. He was her religion. And she was his.

浴缸里的水凉了，但两人之间的热度足以煮沸海洋。在这个贴着瓷砖的小房间里，伴随着消毒水和性爱的气味，陈默意识到他不仅仅是她的搭档。他是她的宗教。而她也是他的。
