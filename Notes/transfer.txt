Woke up to the smell of fresh coffee this morning. That little moment of bliss when the first sip warms your whole body. Found a dollar in my old jeans while doing laundry—score! My neighbor's cat actually purred when I petted it today; usually it just ignores me. These tiny moments make life worth living, you know? They're like little presents scattered throughout your day. Nothing big, just simple, everyday happiness that makes you smile. That's what 小确幸 is all about—those little sparks of joy that light up your ordinary days.
