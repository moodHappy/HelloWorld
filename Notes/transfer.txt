Part 1: The Sound of Perfection

第一部分：完美之声

The morning sun filtered through the high, arched windows of St. Cecilia’s Academy, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air of the grand music hall. In the center of the stage sat the "Glass Swan," Miyetsuko Lin. Her fingers moved across the ivory keys of the Steinway with a grace that seemed almost otherworldly.

晨光穿过圣塞西莉亚学院高大的拱窗，照亮了在大礼堂空气中舞动的尘埃。舞台中央坐着“玻璃天鹅”——林美悦子。她的手指在施坦威的象牙键上掠过，那份优雅仿佛不属于这个尘世。

To her classmates watching from the shadows of the entrance, she was a masterpiece—beautiful, cold, and untouchable.

对于那些躲在入口阴影处窥视的同学来说，她是一件杰作：美丽、冰冷、不可触碰。

"You’re early, Miyetsuko-sama," a soft voice called out.

“您来早了，美悦子大人，”一个温柔的声音响起。

Saori Mikage stood at the edge of the stage, holding a thermos of warm herbal tea. She wore a perfectly tailored navy blazer, her hair pulled back into a sophisticated bun. She was the picture of a refined personal assistant and school tutor.

御影沙织站在舞台边缘，手里提着一个装有温草本茶的保温杯。她穿着裁剪得体的海军蓝西装外套，头发扎成精致的发髻。她完美地诠释了一个优雅的私人助理兼校园导师形象。

"I wanted to perfect the bridge of the second movement," Miyetsuko replied, her voice calm and melodic. "Did Father call this morning?"

“我想完善第二乐章的衔接部分，”美悦子回答，声音平静而悦耳。“父亲今天早上打电话了吗？”

"He’s in a high-level board meeting," Saori said, offering a warm, reassuring smile. "But he sent his love. He said he wouldn’t miss your spring recital for anything in the world."

“他正在参加一个高级董事会议，”沙织说着，露出了一个温暖且令人安心的微笑。“但他带话表达了对您的关爱。他说，无论发生什么，他都不会错过您的春季演奏会。”

Miyetsuko nodded, a small, genuine smile flickering on her lips. In her world, the only clouds were minor keys and difficult compositions.

美悦子点点头，唇角掠过一抹真实而细微的笑意。在她的世界里，唯一的阴云不过是几个小调和艰涩的曲谱。

Part 2: The Peppermint Intruder

第二部分：薄荷味的入侵者

The "Swan’s" peace was shattered during the afternoon break. Miyetsuko was sitting on a stone bench in the West Courtyard, a book of poetry in her lap, when a sudden thwack echoed against the brick wall.

“天鹅”的宁静在下午茶休时分被打破了。美悦子正坐在西中庭的石凳上，膝上放着一本诗集，这时一阵突然的“砰”声撞击在砖墙上。

An orange basketball bounced off the wall and rolled directly toward her, bumping into her polished loafers.

一颗橙色的篮球从墙上弹起，径直滚向她，撞到了她锃亮的皮鞋上。

"My bad! Hey, could you toss that back?"

“我的错！嘿，能帮忙扔回来吗？”

Miyetsuko looked up. A boy was jogging toward her, his school tie undone and his white shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He radiated a raw, sun-kissed energy that felt completely foreign to this sterile environment. This was Takumi Rikuno, the new transfer student on a sports scholarship.

美悦子抬起头。一个男孩正向她慢跑过来，校服领带没系，白衬衫袖子卷到肘部。他散发着一种原始的、带着阳光气息的活力，与这无菌的环境格格不入。他是陆野拓海，一名靠体育奖学金进来的转校生。

Miyetsuko stared at the ball, then at him, her expression hardening into its usual icy mask. "Sports are restricted to the East Field. This is a quiet zone."

美悦子盯着球，又看向他，表情恢复了惯常的冰冷面具。“运动仅限于东操场。这里是安静区域。”

"Wow, you really are the 'Ice Queen' they talk about," Takumi laughed, undeterred. He picked up the ball himself, leaning in slightly. He smelled of laundry detergent and fresh peppermint. "I'm Takumi. And you're... the girl who looks like she’s made of sugar and glass."

“哇，你果然像他们说的那样，是个‘冰山女王’，”拓海笑着，毫不退缩。他自己捡起球，微微凑近。他身上有一股洗衣液和新鲜薄荷的味道。“我是拓海。而你……是那个看起来像糖和玻璃雕成的女孩。”

"I am Lin Miyetsuko," she said stiffly. "And I would appreciate it if you kept your distance."

“我是林美悦子，”她僵硬地说道，“如果你能保持距离，我会很感激。”

"Sure thing, Princess. But you should try smiling. It’s too sunny to be this grumpy." He gave her a playful wink and jogged back to the courts, leaving Miyetsuko staring after him in a mix of confusion and irritation.

“没问题，公主。不过你真该试着笑笑，天气这么好，别总冷着脸。”他俏皮地眨了眨眼，跑向球场，留下美悦子在一阵困惑与恼怒中盯着他的背影。

Part 3: The Interest Payment

第三部分：利息的偿付

As the sunset painted the sky in shades of bruised purple, Miyetsuko was safely tucked away in the back of the family limousine, heading home to a warm dinner.

当夕阳将天空染成一片淤青般的紫色时，美悦子正安稳地坐在自家加长轿车的后座，回家享用温馨的晚餐。

At the same time, in a high-end, windowless office near the business district, Saori Mikage was no longer the refined academy tutor.

与此同时，在商业区附近一间高端、无窗的办公室内，御影沙织不再是那位优雅的学院导师。

She stood before a massive mahogany desk. Across from her sat a representative of the Kurosaki Group, a man whose smile didn't reach his cold, calculating eyes.

她站在巨大的红木办公桌前。对面坐着黑崎集团的代表，一个笑容从未到达那双阴冷、精明的眼睛的男人。

"The Lin family’s latest investment has... stalled," the man said, sliding a folder across the desk. "The debt is mounting. We’re considering seizing the estate. Including the girl's piano."

“林家最近的投资……停滞了，”男人说着，将一个文件夹推过桌面。“债务在累积。我们在考虑没收房产。包括那个女孩的钢琴。”

Saori’s hand tightened on her handbag, but her face remained a calm, professional mask. "Mr. Lin is working on a solution. Please. Miyetsuko has her recital this week. She cannot be disturbed."

沙织握着手包的手猛地收紧，但她的脸依然维持着冷静、职业的面具。“林先生正在想办法。求你了。美悦子这周有演奏会。她不能被打扰。”

"Disturbed?" The man stood up and walked around the desk, his hand reaching out to stroke the silk of Saori’s blazer. "Purity is expensive, Saori. If you want to keep the 'Swan' in her golden cage, someone has to pay the interest."

“打扰？”男人站起身走过办公桌，伸手抚摸着沙织西装的丝绸面料。“纯洁是很昂贵的，沙织。如果你想让那只‘天鹅’留在她的黄金笼子里，就得有人来付利息。”

Saori closed her eyes for a brief second, the image of Miyetsuko’s innocent, smiling face in the music hall flickering in her mind. When she opened them, they were dark and resolute.

沙织短暂地闭上眼睛，脑海中闪过美悦子在音乐厅里那张纯真、微笑的脸。当她睁开眼时，目光幽暗而坚定。

"I understand," she whispered. With trembling fingers, she reached for the zipper of her dress, the professional tutor disappearing as she prepared to descend into the filth to keep her student’s world clean. "Just... leave her out of this. She doesn't need to know."

“我明白了，”她低声呢喃。颤抖的手指伸向裙子的拉链，那位职业导师消失了，她正准备坠入污秽，以换取她的学生世界的洁净。“只要……别把她牵扯进来。她不需要知道这些。”
