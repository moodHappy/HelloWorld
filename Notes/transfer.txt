The Secret in the Heirloom Photo Album

While cleaning her grandmother's attic, Mei discovered the worn leather album. Its pages held generations of family photographs, each carefully preserved. As she turned the brittle pages, a small envelope slipped from behind a 1940s wedding photo. Inside was a letter written in elegant Chinese characters, revealing that her great-grandfather had hidden his true identity to escape political persecution. The family name she had known her entire life was not their own. Tears welled in Mei's eyes as she realized this secret had been guarded for decades, entrusted now to her to decide whether to reveal or protect.
