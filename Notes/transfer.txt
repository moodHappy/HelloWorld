Chapter 60: The Blueprint of Death

第六十章：死亡蓝图

Later that night. 3:00 AM.

那一夜晚些时候。凌晨3点。

Miyetsuko lay asleep, one arm draped over the side of the bed.

美悦子睡着了，一只手臂搭在床边。

Chen Mo was awake. He sat by the window in a silk robe, a glass of whiskey in hand. On the coffee table in front of him was a holographic blueprint projector.

陈默醒着。他穿着丝绸睡袍坐在窗边，手里端着一杯威士忌。面前的茶几上是一台全息蓝图投影仪。

It displayed the 3D layout of the Tokyo Detention House.

它显示着东京拘留所的3D布局图。

"Sector 4. Solitary Confinement," Chen Mo muttered, zooming in on a specific cell.

“第四区。单独监禁，”陈默低语，放大到一个特定的牢房。

Kurosaki was there. Waiting for trial. Or waiting for Mishima to silence him.

黑崎就在那里。等待审判。或者等待三岛让他闭嘴。

"Access points: None. Food delivery: Automated. Guards: Rotated every 4 hours."

“接入点：无。食物配送：自动化。警卫：每4小时轮换。”

It was a fortress designed to keep people in, and keep assassins out.

那是一座为了把人关在里面，也为了把杀手挡在外面而设计的堡垒。

"How do we get in?" Miyetsuko's voice came from the bed. She was awake, watching him.

“我们怎么进去？”美悦子的声音从床上传来。她醒了，看着他。

"We don't," Chen Mo didn't turn around. "We are too high profile now. If we go near that prison, Mishima will know."

“我们不进去，”陈默没回头。“我们现在太高调了。如果我们靠近那个监狱，三岛会知道。”

"Then how?" She walked over, wrapping her arms around his neck from behind, resting her chin on his shoulder. She looked at the blue hologram glowing in the dark.

“那怎么做？”她走过来，从背后搂住他的脖子，下巴搁在他肩上。看着黑暗中发光的蓝色全息图。

"We send a trojan horse," Chen Mo pointed to the infirmary section of the prison. "Kurosaki has a heart condition. He takes medication daily."

“我们送个特洛伊木马进去，”陈默指着监狱的医务室区域。“黑崎有心脏病。他每天都要吃药。”

"Poison?"

“毒药？”

"Too obvious. Mishima will test his food," Chen Mo shook his head. "No. We give him something else. Something he wants."

“太明显了。三岛会检测他的食物，”陈默摇头。“不。我们要给他点别的。他想要的东西。”

"What does a dying man want?"

“一个快死的人想要什么？”

"Hope," Chen Mo smiled coldly. "We make him believe he can escape. We send him a message. A way out."

“希望，”陈默冷笑。“我们要让他相信他能逃跑。给他发个信息。一条出路。”

Miyetsuko's eyes lit up. She understood.

美悦子的眼睛亮了。她懂了。

"And when he takes the bait... when he tries to run..."

“当他咬钩的时候……当他试图逃跑的时候……”

"Mishima's guards will panic. They will shoot him. Or..." Chen Mo tapped the hologram. "Or we trigger the 'fail-safe' in the escape route."

“三岛的警卫会恐慌。他们会开枪。或者……”陈默敲了敲全息图。“或者我们在逃跑路线上触发‘保险丝’。”

"Cruel," she kissed his cheek. "Making him run towards his death, thinking it's freedom."

“真残忍，”她吻了吻他的脸颊。“让他奔向死亡，却以为那是自由。”

"It's poetic justice," Chen Mo turned off the hologram. The room plunged back into darkness. "He made you a prisoner in your own home. Now, we make his prison his grave."

“这是诗意的正义，”陈默关掉全息图。房间重回黑暗。“他曾把你囚禁在自己的家里。现在，我们要把他的监狱变成他的坟墓。”

(End of Phase 16)

Status:

 * Plan: Assassinate Kurosaki by tricking him into a failed escape attempt.

 * Method: Cyber-manipulation and psychological warfare.

 * Atmosphere: Cold, calculating revenge.

Next Phase: The Bait.

They need to contact Kurosaki inside the prison.

They need a corrupt guard. Or a hacked lawyer.

And they need to do it while Mishima is watching their every move.

This is a game of 4D chess played with human lives.
