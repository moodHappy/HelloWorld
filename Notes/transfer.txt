Chapter 16: The Identical Number

第十六章：相同的号码

Miyetsuko went downstairs to the kitchen, the floorboards creaking under her weight. Her father was sitting at the table, a half-eaten bowl of instant noodles in front of him. The only light came from the buzzing refrigerator. He looked exhausted, his skin sallow under the dim light.

美悦子走下楼来到厨房，木地板在她的体重下发出吱呀声。父亲坐在桌边，面前是一碗吃了一半的方便面。唯一的亮光来自嗡嗡作响的冰箱。他看起来精疲力竭，在昏暗的灯光下皮肤显得暗淡发黄。

Suddenly, his phone on the table began to vibrate, its screen lighting up the dark room. He didn't pick it up immediately. He just stared at it with a look of pure dread. Miyetsuko leaned over to grab a glass of water, her eyes darting to the screen.

突然，桌上的手机开始震动，屏幕照亮了昏暗的房间。他没有立刻接听，只是带着一种纯粹的恐惧盯着它。美悦子弯腰去拿水杯，目光顺势扫向屏幕。

Her heart skipped a beat. The number on the screen was burned into her memory. It was the exact same sequence of digits she had seen on Mizuki’s phone just an hour ago—the unread message from the mysterious "stranger." This wasn't a coincidence.

她的心跳漏了一拍。屏幕上的号码已经刻在了她的脑海里。这串数字与她一小时前在美月眠手机上看到的那个号码一模一样——那个来自神秘“陌生人”的未读短信。这绝不是巧合。

"Aren't you going to answer it?" she asked softly, her voice trembling. Her father flinched, quickly grabbing the phone and shoving it into his pocket. "It's just a telemarketer," he lied, but the cold sweat on his forehead told a much darker story.

“你不接吗？”她轻声问道，声音有些发颤。父亲瑟缩了一下，飞快地抓起手机塞进口袋。“只是个推销电话，”他撒谎道，但他额头上的冷汗却在诉说着一个更阴暗的故事。
