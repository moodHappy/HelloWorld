# The Owl and the Fireflies

An owl who prided himself on his wisdom noticed fireflies creating beautiful patterns in the night sky. "How simple," he hooted. "I can do better." He tried to mimic their light with his own eyes, but could only produce a faint glow. The fireflies laughed gently. "Each creature has its own gifts," they said. "True wisdom comes from understanding this." The owl nodded, realizing that true intelligence isn't about copying others but appreciating different kinds of knowledge. From that night on, he admired the fireflies' unique talents while sharing his own wisdom with those who needed it.
