Here's a 100-word short story at CEFR Level B1:

"Yesterday, I visited the museum. I saw old photos and learned about the past. One picture caught my eye - a farmer working in the field. It looked just like my grandfather. I realized that not much has changed. People still work hard, just like before. The museum showed me that history is connected to our lives today. It's like a bridge between the past and now. I felt proud of my grandfather and others like him. Their hard work built the foundation for our lives today."
