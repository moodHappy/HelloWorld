Part 1: The Rooftop Sanctuary

第一部分：天台避难所

Lunchtime at St. Cecilia’s was a performance. In the grand dining hall, girls from the country’s most powerful families sat in cliques, dissecting each other’s social standings over organic salads. Miyetsuko hated it. The air was thick with fake smiles and hidden daggers.

圣塞西莉亚学院的午餐时间是一场表演。在宏伟的餐厅里，来自国内权势显赫家族的女孩们三五成群，在有机沙拉的陪伴下解构着彼此的社会地位。美悦子讨厌这一切。空气中弥漫着虚假的微笑和暗藏的刀锋。

Holding her elaborate, three-tiered bento box prepared by the family chef, she slipped away to the restricted rooftop. It was the only place where the "Glass Swan" could breathe without being watched.

她拎着家里厨师准备的精致三层便当，偷偷溜向了禁止进入的天台。那是“玻璃天鹅”唯一可以避开众人视线、自由呼吸的地方。

But as she pushed open the heavy steel door, the scent of expensive old wood was replaced by something sharp and savory.

但当她推开沉重的钢门时，陈旧木材的气味被一种辛辣而咸香的味道取代了。

Part 2: The Commoner’s Feast

第二部分：平民的盛宴

Takumi was there, sprawled out on a rusted bench with his legs dangling. He was tearing into a plastic-wrapped Yakisoba bread—a cheap, carb-heavy staple of convenience stores.

拓海在那儿，四肢舒展地躺在生锈的长椅上，双腿晃荡着。他正狼吞虎咽地吃着一个塑料包装的炒面面包——那是便利店里最便宜、碳水含量极高的主食。

"Hey! You again," Takumi said, muffled by a mouthful of noodles. He grinned, unbothered by her sudden intrusion. "Did the swan get tired of the lake?"

“嘿！又是你，”拓海嘴里塞满了面条，含糊不清地说道。他笑了笑，丝毫没因她的突然闯入而感到不适。“天鹅也游腻了湖水吗？”

"This area is off-limits," Miyetsuko said, though she didn't leave. She looked at his lunch with a mixture of curiosity and pity. "Are you... allowed to eat that? It looks incredibly unhealthy."

“这里是禁区，”美悦子说道，尽管她并没有离开。她带着好奇与怜悯交织的眼神看着他的午餐。“你……被允许吃那个吗？看起来非常不健康。”

"It’s called 'soul food,' Princess," Takumi laughed, patting the spot next to him. "Way better than whatever gold-plated lettuce you’ve got in there. Want a bite?"

“这叫‘灵魂食物’，公主，”拓海笑着拍了拍身边的位置，“比你那盒子里装的镀金生菜强多了。想尝一口吗？”

Miyetsuko hesitated, then sat down—maintaining a careful distance. She opened her bento: wagyu beef slices, hand-rolled sushi, and delicate edible flowers. It looked like a museum exhibit.

美悦子迟疑了一下，坐了下来——保持着谨慎的距离。她打开便当：和牛切片、手作寿司和精致的食用花卉。看起来就像件博物馆展品。

"Trade you a piece of steak for a bite of the... soul food?" she whispered.

“用一块和牛换一口……灵魂食物，好吗？”她轻声问。

When she bit into the cheap bread, the burst of salty sauce and soft dough was a revelation. It tasted like freedom. For a moment, she forgot about her father’s missing calls and the heavy expectations of the Lin name.

当她咬下那口廉价面包时，咸香的酱汁和松软的面团让她有种如获新生的感觉。那是自由的味道。那一刻，她忘记了父亲没接的电话，也忘记了林氏家族那沉重的期望。

Part 3: The Fragile Peace

第三部分：脆弱的和平

While Miyetsuko shared a laugh with Takumi under the summer sky, the basement level of the Lin mansion was cold.

当美悦子在夏日天空下与拓海分享笑声时，林家大宅的地下室却是一片冰冷。

Saori was standing in the wine cellar, her back against the cold stone wall. Her blouse was wrinkled, and her breathing was ragged. In front of her stood a man in a charcoal suit—a collector for the Kurosaki-linked shadow firms.

沙织站在酒窖里，背靠着冰冷的石墙。她的衬衫皱巴巴的，呼吸急促。在她面前站着一个穿炭灰色西装的男人——他是与黑崎家有关联的影子公司的收账人。

"The Chairman is losing patience, Saori-san," the man said, wiping his hands with a white handkerchief. "The interest paid last night only bought you twelve hours. We need a real commitment."

“董事长正在失去耐心，沙织小姐，”男人用白手帕擦着手说道，“昨晚付的利息只为你换回了十二个小时。我们需要真正的承诺。”

Saori pulled her blazer closed, her fingers trembling as she adjusted her collar to hide the fresh purple marks on her collarbone. "I am working on the offshore accounts. Just give me until the end of the school week. Miyetsuko... she finally looks happy. Don't ruin it yet."

沙织拉紧了西装外套，手指颤抖着调整领口，试图掩盖锁骨上新鲜的紫色痕迹。“我正在处理离岸账户。再给我一点时间，直到本周放假。美悦子……她终于看起来很开心了。先别毁了这一切。”

"Happiness is for people who don't owe fifty billion yen," the man sneered, leaning in close. He grabbed a lock of her hair, smelling the expensive shampoo she used to blend into the academy. "But you’re a good girl, Saori. You know how to keep a secret. As long as you keep 'servicing' the debt, the swan gets to stay in her dream."

“幸福是给那些不欠五百亿日元的人准备的，”男人冷笑着凑近。他抓起她的一缕头发，闻着她为了融入学院而使用的昂贵洗发水味。“但你是个乖女孩，沙织。你知道怎么守秘密。只要你继续‘偿付’债务，那天鹅就能留在她的美梦里。”

Saori stared at the floor, a single tear tracing a path through her makeup. "I’ll do whatever you want. Just stay away from the school."

沙织盯着地板，一行泪水冲开了脸上的妆容。“你们想要什么我都做。只要离学校远点。”

Episode 2 Ending:

Miyetsuko returns to class with a smudge of Yakisoba sauce on her lip, feeling a strange, fluttery excitement in her chest. She sees Saori waiting by the car after school, looking perfectly composed as always.

美悦子回到教室时，嘴角还沾着一点炒面酱汁，胸口跳动着一种奇妙的、小鹿乱撞般的兴奋感。放学后，她看到沙织在车旁等候，一如既往地沉稳、优雅。

"Did you have a good day, Miyetsuko-sama?" Saori asks, her voice steady despite the bruises hidden under her silk clothes.

“您今天过得愉快吗，美悦子大人？”沙织问道，尽管丝绸衣服下满是淤青，她的声音依然平稳如初。

"The best," Miyetsuko smiles, completely blind to the rot beneath her feet.

“好极了，”美悦子微笑着，对脚下的腐朽毫无所觉。
