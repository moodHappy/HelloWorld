After his wife passed away, John was down in the dumps. His world had come crashing down, leaving him out in the cold. Every corner of their home held memories that made his heart ache. "It's water under the bridge now," he'd tell himself, but the words rang hollow. Nights were the worstâ€”when the world slept, his loneliness kept him awake. He'd missed the boat on happiness, or so it seemed. Still, as dawn broke each day, he put on a brave face, hoping against hope that someday he wouldn't feel like such a fish out of water in his own life.
