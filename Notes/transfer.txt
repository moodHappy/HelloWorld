Many people sit in meetings which are not good. In the UK, workers go to many bad meetings. But we can make meetings better.

Before the meeting, people should know the topics to talk about. They have time to think about what to say. The boss can send a plan. Some people talk a lot. Some people are quiet. It is good to help all people talk. In online meetings, we can see names. We can click to talk. In some meetings, some people are in a room and some people are online. These meetings are harder to manage.

Short breaks are good. People can drink tea or walk. After the meeting, the boss can say thank you and send a message to all.

Difficult words: topic (a thing to talk about), quiet (not talking much), manage (to deal with a situation).
