Chapter 19: The New Law of Rio

第十九章：里约的新法则

"Command?" Fantasma laughed nervously. "Lady, you are brave. But this is my boat. These are my men."

“指挥？”幽灵紧张地笑了。“女士，你很勇敢。但这可是我的船。这些人是我的手下。”

He gestured to the dozen armed guards around them.

他指了指周围那十几名武装警卫。

Miyetsuko didn't even look at them. She looked at the tablet in the glass.

美悦子看都没看他们一眼。她看着杯子里的平板。

"That tablet contains the port authority codes. With it, I can move your cocaine through customs without inspection. Without it... you are just a thug with too much product and no way to sell it."

“那个平板里有港务局的代码。有了它，我可以让你的可卡因通过海关而不受检查。没有它……你只是个囤积了太多货却卖不出去的流氓。”

She straightened up, letting the robe fall open completely for a second before wrapping it tight. That brief flash of her blood-streaked, magnificent body was a calculated move. It wasn't nudity; it was a display of raw power. It said: I have nothing to hide, and nothing to fear.

她直起身，让睡袍完全敞开了一秒，然后紧紧裹住。那一瞬间，她那布满血痕、宏伟的身体一闪而过，那是经过计算的举动。那不是裸露；那是原始力量的展示。它在说：我无所隐瞒，也无所畏惧。

"Your men follow money, Fantasma. I can make them rich. Can you?"

“你的人是跟着钱走的，幽灵。我能让他们发财。你能吗？”

Fantasma stared at her. He looked at the blood on her skin, the fire in her eyes, and the absolute lack of shame.

幽灵盯着她。他看着她皮肤上的血，眼里的火，还有那绝对的无耻。

He had seen many killers. But he had never seen a woman who wore murder like a diamond necklace.

他见过很多杀手。但他从未见过一个把谋杀像钻石项链一样戴在身上的女人。

"You are crazy," Fantasma whispered. "A bruja (witch)."

“你疯了，”幽灵低语。“是个女巫。”

"I am necessary," she corrected him. She picked up his cigar from the ashtray, took a drag, and blew the smoke into his face.

“我是必须的，”她纠正他。她从烟灰缸里拿起他的雪茄，吸了一口，把烟雾吐在他脸上。

"Clean the cabin. Dump the body in the Atlantic. And get me a clean dress. Something white."

“清理船舱。把尸体扔进大西洋。给我找件干净的裙子。要白色的。”

She turned to walk away, the silk robe trailing behind her on the bloody deck.

她转身走开，丝绸睡袍在她身后的血腥甲板上拖曳。

"Wait," Fantasma called out. "What about him?" He pointed at Chen Mo.

“等等，”幽灵叫道。“那他呢？”他指着陈默。

Miyetsuko stopped. She looked back at Chen Mo.

美悦子停下。她回头看陈默。

Chen Mo was wiping his bloody hands on a napkin, his expression unreadable.

陈默正在用餐巾擦拭血手，表情难以捉摸。

"He is my leash," she smiled, a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Without him, I might bite you."

“他是我的狗链，”她笑了，笑意未达眼底。“没有他，我可能会咬死你。”

Fantasma shivered. He looked at his men.

幽灵打了个寒颤。他看了看他的手下。

"Do as she says," he ordered quietly. "Dump the pig."

“照她说的做，”他低声命令。“把那头猪扔了。”
