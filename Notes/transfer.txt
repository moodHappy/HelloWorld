The Kingdom of Kalik's centennial parade was about to begin.
 Soldiers lined the wide avenues, banners fluttering in the morning breeze, and the crowd gathered with eager anticipation.
 At the palace balcony, King Alaric—resolute and dignified—awaited the arrival of his distinguished guests.

From the grand gates approached Rex Vito, the battle-hardened general whose reputation for war stretched across continents.
 At his side walked Lord Kivan, a small but formidable despot whose iron will shaped every corner of his homeland.
 King Alaric positioned himself between them as they ascended the palace steps, forming a striking trio before the watching crowd.

They spoke quietly as they walked, translators carrying every word across languages.
 Lord Kivan broke the ice first.
 “It is a pleasure to see you again, Your Majesty,” he said.

King Alaric inclined his head, a faint smile tugging at his lips.
 “And I as well… it has been far too long.
”

For a stretch, silence fell, broken only by the soft sound of ceremonial footsteps.
 Then, as their conversation turned to the passage of time, the translators’ voices became clear once more.

Rex Vito’s interpreter announced: “With advances in biotechnology, organs can be replaced, bodies rejuvenated… humans may grow ever younger, and perhaps even live indefinitely.
”

King Alaric’s gaze grew distant, contemplative.
 “Difficult to predict… perhaps, in this century, mankind may live to one hundred and fifty years.
”

Lord Kivan’s lips curled into a subtle grin, eyes glinting with ambition.
 The crowd below remained oblivious, cheering for the parade, while the three leaders shared a glance that spoke volumes—silent acknowledgment of power, ambition, and the strange allure of immortality.
