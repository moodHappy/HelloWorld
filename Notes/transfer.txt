When Google Maps introduced the "Fog of War" setting, Dave's life became an adventure. His street vanished from view until he physically walked it. The grocery store appeared as a mysterious question mark until he bravely ventured inside. "I've lived here ten years!" he yelled at his phone, which showed only a gray void where his neighborhood should be. His commute became a quest, with Dave "unlocking" new routes like a video game character. When he finally discovered a shortcut that had existed all along, he triumphantly planted a flag in his front yard. His wife just shook her head and used a regular map.
