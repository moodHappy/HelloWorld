The gray blanket of clouds hung low, muffling the city sounds. Maria walked without purpose, her footsteps the only rhythm in the damp air. The absence of shadows made everything feel flat, as if the world had lost its dimension. She remembered how her grandmother had called these days "sky's resting days." A droplet landed on her cheek, not quite rain yet. Somewhere above, the sun still existed, hidden but not gone. Maria found comfort in that thought as she continued walking, the overcast sky a temporary canopy for her wandering thoughts.
