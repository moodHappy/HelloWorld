当然。下面是一篇英文微小说，语言克制、意象明确，偏文学风格，篇幅很短但留有余味。

The Last Message

Every evening at 7:13, the phone vibrated.

No name. No number. Just a single sentence on the screen:
I am still here.

At first, she thought it was a glitch. Then a prank. Then a coincidence that refused to end.

She had buried her father three years ago. Watched the coffin disappear. Signed the papers. Learned how to speak of him in the past tense.

Yet the message came—always the same, always on time.

One night, she replied.

Where?

The phone was silent for a long moment. Then it vibrated again.

In the life you kept living.

The messages stopped after that.

But every evening at 7:13, she still paused—
and listened to the quiet,
as if it were answering her.
