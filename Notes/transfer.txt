Chapter 2: The Stranger on the Finance Magazine

第二章：财经杂志上的陌生人

This string of numbers hooked Chen Mo's curiosity like a fishhook.

这串数字像个鱼钩，死死钩住了陈默的好奇心。

Just as he was staring blankly at the numbers, a photo on a bento box liner (an expired evening finance newspaper) he bought from the convenience store stung his eyes.

就在他盯着那串数字发呆时，便利店买回来的便当垫纸（一张过期的财经晚报）上，一张照片刺痛了他的眼睛。

It was a report on the "Kurosaki Zaibatsu" annual charity gala. The photo occupied half the page. In the center was an old man with gray hair and hawk-like eyes—the head of the Kurosaki Zaibatsu and the president of Kurosaki Heavy Industries.

那是一篇关于“黑崎财团”年度慈善晚宴的报道。照片占据了半个版面，中间是一个头发花白、眼神鹰隼般锐利的老人，正是黑崎财团的掌门人，黑崎重工的社长。

And the woman holding that old man's arm...

而挽着那个老头手臂的女人……

Although she wore a well-tailored haute couture black evening gown in the photo, her hair pinned high, her makeup cold as an ice sculpture, and her eyes revealing an arrogant refusal to anyone, Chen Mo recognized the collarbone under that necklace at a glance, and the magnificent curves that were ready to burst out from the tight dress.

虽然照片里的她穿着一身剪裁得体的高定黑色晚礼服，头发高高盘起，妆容冷艳得像一尊冰雕，眼神里透着拒人千里的高傲。但陈默一眼就认出了那条项链下的锁骨，以及那被紧身礼服包裹着的、呼之欲出的宏伟曲线。

That night under the yukata, gently trembling with her breath, was exactly this suffocating silhouette.

那晚在浴衣下，随着呼吸轻轻颤巍巍晃动的，正是这令人窒息的轮廓。

The caption under the photo read: President Kurosaki and his wife, Kurosaki Miyetsuko (Original name: Lin Miyetsu).

照片下的图注写着：黑崎社长与其夫人，黑崎美悦子（原名：林美悦）。

Chen Mo's hand shook violently, and the lipstick rolled onto the table.

陈默的手猛地抖了一下，口红滚落在桌上。

She wasn't some neglected middle-class housewife. She was standing at the pinnacle of Tokyo's power, the wife of the president of the famous military industry giant—Kurosaki Heavy Industries. And that old man was said to be able to summon wind and rain in both political and business circles, with extremely ruthless methods.

她不是什么被冷落的中产阶级家庭主妇。她是站在东京权力顶端、那个赫赫有名的军工企业巨头——黑崎重工的社长夫人。而那个老头，据说在政商两界都能呼风唤雨，手段极其狠辣。

If so, was everything she said in Izu about "husband busy with business, children cramming" a lie? Or was it a sophisticated lie mixed with partial truth?

如果是这样，她在伊豆说的“丈夫忙生意、孩子补习”，全是谎言？或者说，是掺杂了部分真相的高级谎言？

Even more terrifying is, if she was a person of such status, why would she go to such a small inn? And why drag an ordinary corporate slave like him into it?

更可怕的是，如果她是那样身份的人，为什么会去那样一个小旅馆？又为什么会把他这样一个普通社畜卷进来？

What exactly did 10-24-L inside that lipstick mean?

那支口红里的 10-24-L，到底是什么意思？
