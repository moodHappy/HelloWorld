Mr. Chen has been cutting hair at the same street corner for fifty years. His worn leather chair and straight razor have served generations of local families. Young customers now prefer trendy salons with electric clippers and bright lights. Each morning, Mr. Chen still polishes his mirror and arranges his combs with pride. Sometimes elderly gentlemen visit, not just for a haircut, but for the familiar conversation and the hot towel treatment they remember from their youth. As the neighborhood transforms with glass buildings and chain stores, Mr. Chen wonders who will keep the traditions alive when he's gone. He is the last barber on the street corner.
