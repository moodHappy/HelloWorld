Chapter 61: The Tea House of Whispers

第六十一章：低语茶室

Ginza. "Kitsune" Private Tea House.

银座。“狐”私人茶室。

The room was small, smelling of matcha and cedar. Outside, the rain drummed rhythmically on the bamboo roof.

房间很小，弥漫着抹茶和杉木的味道。窗外，雨点有节奏地敲打着竹制屋顶。

Dr. Sato, the chief cardiologist of the Tokyo Detention House, sat on the tatami mat. He was sweating, despite the air conditioning.

佐藤医生，东京拘留所的首席心脏科医生，跪坐在榻榻米上。尽管开着空调，他还是在冒汗。

Across from him sat Miyetsuko. She wore a midnight-blue kimono, conservative yet impeccably expensive. She poured tea with the grace of a practiced hostess.

坐在他对面的是美悦子。她穿着一件午夜蓝的和服，保守却昂贵得无懈可击。她以熟练女主人的优雅倒着茶。

"Dr. Sato," she slid the cup across the table. "I hear my husband's heart is... failing."

“佐藤医生，”她把茶杯推过桌面。“听说我丈夫的心脏……在衰竭。”

"Stress, Mrs. Kurosaki," Sato wiped his forehead. "The trial... the confinement... it is taking a toll."

“压力，黑崎夫人，”佐藤擦了擦额头。“审判……监禁……这对他打击很大。”

"Mishima wants him dead before the trial," she took a sip of her tea. Her eyes over the rim of the cup were like frozen lakes. "He will offer you money to overdose him. Or switch his pills."

“三岛想让他在审判前死，”她抿了一口茶。杯沿上方的眼睛像冰封的湖面。“他会给你钱让你给他注射过量药物。或者换掉他的药丸。”

Sato flinched. He had already received that call.

佐藤瑟缩了一下。他确实已经接到了那个电话。

"I... I took an oath..."

“我……我发过誓……”

"Oaths don't pay gambling debts, Doctor," Chen Mo stepped out from the shadows of the sliding door. He placed a thick envelope on the table. It wasn't money. It was photos. Photos of Sato at an illegal underground casino run by the Yakuza.

“誓言还不了赌债，医生，”陈默从拉门后的阴影里走出来。他把一个厚信封放在桌上。不是钱。是照片。佐藤在极道运行的地下赌场里的照片。

"We don't want you to kill him," Miyetsuko smiled gently. She reached into her obi sash and pulled out a small, white capsule. It looked exactly like Kurosaki's heart medication. "We want you to save him."

“我们要你别杀他，”美悦子温柔地笑了。她伸手进腰带，拿出一颗白色的小胶囊。看起来和黑崎的心脏药一模一样。“我们要你救他。”

She placed the capsule next to the envelope.

她把胶囊放在信封旁边。

"Inside this is a message. Give it to him. Tell him it's from his 'loyalists'. Tell him it's the only way he survives tonight."

“这里面是一个信息。给他。告诉他这是他的‘死忠派’给他的。告诉他这是他今晚活下来的唯一机会。”

Sato looked at the capsule, then at the photos.

佐藤看着胶囊，又看着照片。

"What happens if I do this?"

“如果我做了会怎么样？”

"You walk away with your debts paid," Chen Mo leaned in. "Refuse, and Mishima will kill you anyway to tie up loose ends. We are your only lifeboat."

“你债务两清，全身而退，”陈默凑近说。“拒绝的话，三岛反正也会杀你灭口。我们是你唯一的救生艇。”
