The old electric fan stood faithfully in the corner of Grandma's room, its three blades slightly yellowed with age. Every summer, it provided the only relief from sweltering heat. I remember falling asleep to its rhythmic humming, watching as it gently stirred the curtains. Last year, it stopped working mid-heatwave. Grandma insisted we couldn't replace it. "Some things," she whispered, "hold more than just air." Now it sits as a reminder of cooler days and simpler times, its silent blades still capturing memories of breezy afternoons and the comfort of its constant presence in our lives.
