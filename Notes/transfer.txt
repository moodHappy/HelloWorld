Awkward Moment

It happened in the elevator.

Jason was already late, juggling his phone, his coffee, and his dignity. He slipped into the elevator just as the doors were closing and sighed in relief.

Only one other person was inside—a woman standing in the corner, earbuds in, staring at the numbers above the door.

The elevator started moving.

Jason’s phone buzzed. A message from his friend popped up:

Did you fart again at work?

Jason snorted before he could stop himself.

The sound echoed. Loud. Sharp.

The woman’s head tilted slightly.

Jason cleared his throat. “Uh… allergies.”

She didn’t respond.

To make things worse, his stomach chose that exact moment to betray him.

A noise. Low. Unmistakable.

Time froze.

The elevator hummed. The numbers climbed painfully slowly.

The woman finally pulled out one earbud and looked at him. Not angry. Just curious.

“Long morning?” she asked.

Jason’s face burned. “You have no idea.”

She smiled. The doors opened.

She stepped out, paused, and said, “For what it’s worth, I thought it was my floor.”

Then she was gone.

Jason stayed inside for another ten seconds, staring at the closing doors, seriously considering changing jobs.
