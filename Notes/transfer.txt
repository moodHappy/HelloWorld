Old Frank spends every weekend at the lake with his expensive fishing gear, "Today's the day I'll catch the big one," he declares for the hundredth time. His wife just rolls her eyes. Frank hasn't caught a fish in five years, but that doesn't stop him from lecturing beginners about "proper technique." His friends joke that Frank's real talent is finding creative excusesâ€”"The fish are on vacation today" or "They must know I'm a vegetarian." Still, there he sits, middle-aged belly hanging over his pants, telling fish stories about the ones that got away, blissfully unaware he's become the punchline.
