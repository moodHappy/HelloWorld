Another Story

He hadn’t planned to stay at a hotel.

The apartment renovation was supposed to take three days—replace the bathroom tiles, fix a leak, paint one wall. Three days became a week. The contractor shrugged, said the pipes were older than both of them. His wife moved in with her sister, closer to work. He booked a cheap hotel near the station because it was temporary, because temporary things felt easier to justify.

The room smelled faintly of detergent and something metallic. The desk was too small, the chair slightly loose. Still, it had Wi-Fi, and that was enough. He worked there at night, laptop open, wedding ring tapping softly against the keyboard when his hands got tired.

He told himself he liked the anonymity. No neighbors, no polite conversations. Just passing faces in the hallway, people who wouldn’t remember him.

On the second morning, he took the elevator down with his head full of deadlines. Halfway down, someone stepped in.

A woman with grocery bags. Plastic cutting into her fingers. She looked familiar in a way that made his stomach tighten—not recognition exactly, more like déjà vu. He glanced up, then away. The rules of adulthood were clear: don’t stare, don’t ask, don’t open doors you don’t intend to walk through.

Still, when the elevator stopped and she stepped out, he caught himself looking at her reflection in the closing doors. For a brief, irrational moment, he thought: I’ve seen her before.

The thought annoyed him. Memory played tricks. Everyone looked like someone from the past if you stared long enough.

That afternoon, he worked at a café near the station. Same order as always: bitter coffee, no sugar. He noticed he was distracted, rereading the same paragraph over and over. His phone buzzed once—a message from his wife about paint colors. He replied with a thumbs-up and felt strangely hollow afterward.

That evening, back at the hotel, he stood in the hallway longer than necessary, listening to the hum of the building. Somewhere a TV played too loudly. A door slammed. Life, condensed.

He wondered, briefly, why he felt restless. Nothing was wrong. This was a pause, nothing more. Renovations finished, routines resumed, everything slid back into place.

On the last day, as he checked out, he passed the elevator again. Empty this time. He felt an unexpected sense of relief.

Outside, the city moved the way it always did—buses idling, people walking with purpose. He adjusted his jacket and headed toward the station, already thinking about the meeting ahead, the email he still needed to send.

The hotel receded behind him, just another building he wouldn’t return to.

Later, weeks later, there would be moments when a face on the street made him hesitate, when an old memory stirred for no clear reason. He would dismiss it, as he always did.

Some things, he had learned, were better left unexamined.

Not because they were dangerous.

But because they belonged to a life that no longer asked for him.
