Serious Suspicion

Mark started suspecting something was wrong on a Tuesday.

Nothing dramatic—no shouting, no blood, no mysterious notes. Just coffee.

He was sure he’d left the mug on his desk full. When he came back from the bathroom, it was half empty. Still warm.

He frowned at it for a long moment, then drank it anyway.

That night, he checked his phone.
Two steps on the health app.
All day.

“That’s impossible,” he muttered. He worked in a warehouse. He walked all the time.

The next morning, his shoelaces were tied differently. Not wrong—just not his way.

Mark stood in his hallway, staring down at his feet, his heart slowly speeding up.

Someone was in his apartment.

He didn’t call the police. He didn’t tell anyone. Instead, he decided to test it.

Before leaving for work, he placed a coin on the edge of the door, balanced carefully so it would fall if the door opened.

When he came home, the coin was gone.

Not on the floor. Not kicked aside. Gone.

That night, Mark didn’t sleep. He lay in bed, eyes open, listening.

At 3:12 a.m., he heard it.

A soft sound. Like fabric brushing fabric.

Breathing that wasn’t his.

He sat up slowly. “Hello?”

Silence.

He turned on the light.

Nothing. Empty room. Normal walls. Normal mess.

The next day, he installed a cheap camera in the living room. Plugged it into his laptop. Let it record.

At work, his hands shook so badly he dropped a box.

That evening, he rushed home and opened the footage.

Hours of nothing.

Then, at 2:47 a.m., the screen flickered.

The camera showed Mark sleeping on the couch.

Then—movement.

The couch shifted.

Mark sat up on screen.

Scratched his head.

Stood up.

Walked into the kitchen.

The real Mark stared at the screen, cold spreading through his chest.

Because he remembered that night.

He never woke up.
