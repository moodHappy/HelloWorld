Chapter 62: The Paper Crane

第六十二章：纸鹤

Tokyo Detention House. Sector 4. Cell 402.

东京拘留所。第四区。402号牢房。

Kurosaki Soichiro looked like a ghost of his former self. His hair was grey, unkempt. His eyes were sunken.

黑崎宗一郎看起来像过去的幽灵。头发灰白、凌乱。眼窝深陷。

"Medication time," the guard buzzed the door open.

“吃药时间，”警卫嗡的一声打开门。

Dr. Sato walked in, flanked by two guards. He checked Kurosaki's pulse. It was erratic.

佐藤医生走进来，两边跟着两个警卫。他检查黑崎的脉搏。很不稳定。

"BP is 160 over 100," Sato muttered. He reached into his pocket. "Take this. New beta-blocker."

“血压160/100，”佐藤低语。他伸手进口袋。“吃这个。新的β受体阻滞剂。”

He handed Kurosaki the white capsule.

他把那颗白色胶囊递给黑崎。

As he did, he leaned close, pretending to check Kurosaki's eyes.

与此同时，他凑近，假装检查黑崎的眼睛。

"Do not swallow," Sato whispered, his voice barely audible. "Open it. Tonight. Or Mishima kills you."

“别吞，”佐藤耳语，声音几乎听不见。“打开它。今晚。否则三岛会杀了你。”

Kurosaki froze. His survival instinct kicked in. He palmed the pill, pretending to swallow it with a gulp of water. He opened his mouth to show the guards it was gone.

黑崎僵住了。求生本能启动。他把药藏在手心，假装用水吞了下去。他张开嘴给警卫看药没了。

The door slammed shut. Darkness returned.

门砰地关上。黑暗回归。

Kurosaki waited for an hour, until the lights dimmed for the night cycle.

黑崎等了一个小时，直到夜间灯光变暗。

He curled up on his bunk, facing the wall. With trembling fingers, he pulled the capsule from under his tongue. He twisted it open.

他蜷缩在铺位上，面朝墙壁。用颤抖的手指从舌下拿出胶囊。拧开。

There was no powder inside. Just a tightly rolled strip of rice paper.

里面没有药粉。只有一张卷得很紧的米纸。

He unrolled it. The text was microscopic, written in a code he recognized—the old Kurosaki Heavy Industries emergency cipher.

他展开它。上面的字微乎其微，是用他认得的代码写的——旧黑崎重工的紧急密码。

*"Mishima has bought the night shift guards. Suicide order issued for 04:00.

We have hacked the security grid.

At 03:00, the magnetic lock on your cell will fail for 60 seconds.

Corridor B camera loop: Frozen.

Service Elevator 2: Waiting.

Run to the roof. Extraction team inbound.

 * The Loyalists"*

“三岛买通了夜班警卫。自杀命令定于04:00执行。

我们黑入了安保网络。

03:00，你牢房的磁力锁会失效60秒。

B走廊摄像头循环：已冻结。

2号服务电梯：等待中。

跑向屋顶。撤离小组正在进入。

——死忠派”

Kurosaki stared at the paper. Tears welled up in his eyes.

黑崎盯着纸条。泪水涌上眼眶。

"They haven't forgotten me," he whispered. "I still have power."

“他们没忘记我，”他低语。“我还有权力。”

He ate the paper. It dissolved instantly on his tongue. It tasted like hope.

他吃掉了纸条。它在他舌尖瞬间溶解。尝起来像希望。
