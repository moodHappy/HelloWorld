Chapter 10: The Data in the Vault

第十章：金库里的数据

Ten minutes later.

十分钟后。

Miyetsuko stood up from Chen Mo, tidying her slightly messy hair. Her face was flushed with a natural redness, and her eyes were watery, looking incredibly charming.

美悦子从陈默身上站起来，整理了一下微乱的头发。她脸上带着自然的潮红，眼神水润，看起来媚态横生。

Chen Mo lay on the sofa, gasping for air. His collar was messy, his neck covered in conspicuous hickeys, and his body reeked of her strong feminine scent. He looked exactly like a man who had just been drained by a wolf-like woman.

陈默躺在沙发上喘着粗气。他的衣领凌乱，脖子上布满了显眼的吻痕，浑身都是她那股浓烈的女人香。活脱脱一个刚被狼虎之年的女人榨干了的模样。

"The act is done. Now, let's talk business." Miyetsuko's expression instantly returned to coldness, this ability to switch faces was chilling.

“戏演完了。现在说正事。”美悦子的表情瞬间恢复了冷漠，这种变脸的能力让人心惊。

She took out a small USB drive from her bra—it still carried her body temperature—and threw it to Chen Mo.

她从胸衣里掏出一个小巧的U盘——上面还带着她的体温——扔给了陈默。

"Kurosaki Heavy Industries has a secret server room in the basement of the 'Bay Area Logistics Center.' It is physically isolated from the internet. On the 24th of next month, there will be a system maintenance. That is the only window."

“黑崎重工在‘湾区物流中心’的地下有一个秘密机房。那是物理隔绝外网的。下个月24号，那里会有一次系统维护。那是唯一的窗口。”

"What do you want me to steal?" Chen Mo sat up, buttoning his shirt with trembling fingers.

“你要我偷什么？”陈默坐起来，手指颤抖着扣好衬衫扣子。

"Not steal. Upload." Miyetsuko's eyes revealed a trace of madness. "This USB drive contains a Trojan program I bought at a high price. You need to find a way to plug it into their main server. I don't want his money. I want his 'list'."

“不是偷。是上传。”美悦子眼中露出一丝疯狂。“这U盘里有一个我高价买来的木马程序。你要想办法把它插进他们的主服务器。我不要他的钱。我要他的‘名单’。”

"The list?"

“名单？”

"The list of illegal arms deals he made with fluctuating regimes overseas. With that, I can send him to prison, or... make him kneel and beg me for a divorce."

“他和海外动荡政权进行非法军火交易的名单。有了那个，我就能送他进监狱，或者……让他跪下来求我离婚。”

She walked to the door and opened it, then turned back to look at Chen Mo.

她走到门口，拉开了门，然后回头看着陈默。

"Go now. Walk out with your head down, looking exhausted. Remember, you are just a plaything I got tired of playing with tonight. Don't let anyone see the ambition in your eyes."

“走吧。低着头走出去，装作精疲力尽的样子。记住，你只是我今晚玩腻了的消遣。别让人看见你眼里的野心。”

Chen Mo stood up. He touched the hickeys on his neck, which were still throbbing with pain.

陈默站起身。他摸了摸脖子上的吻痕，那里还在突突地跳着疼。

He knew he had boarded a pirate ship. But watching that plump, dangerous, and alluring back figure, he found tragically that he didn't want to get off.

他知道自己上了贼船。但看着那个丰腴、危险又迷人的背影，他悲哀地发现，自己竟然不想下船。
