Chapter 19: Miyetsuko's Date

第十九章：美悦子的约会

Part 1: The Flight from the Palace

逃离皇宫

Miyetsuko didn't go back to the table. She couldn't look at Masato Bai-Feng, and she certainly couldn't look at her father. She slipped out through the hotel’s service entrance, the gold trophy heavy and mocking in her hand.

美悦子没有回到席间。她无法直视白凤雅人，更无法直视她的父亲。她从酒店的员工通道溜了出去，手中的金奖杯沉甸甸的，像是在嘲讽她。

Her phone buzzed again. A location pin. Thirty minutes. Don't be late.

手机再次震动。一个定位信息。三十分钟，别迟到。

She hailed a taxi, her heart drumming a frantic rhythm. She was trading one cage for another, but at least the man in the van didn't smell like the stale cigars of the Palace Hotel.

她拦了一辆出租车，心跳如狂乱的鼓点。她是在从一个笼子跳往另一个笼子，但至少，厢式车里的那个男人身上没有皇宫酒店那种陈腐的雪茄味。

Part 2: The Glass Penthouse

玻璃顶层公寓

The elevator opened directly into a minimalist penthouse overlooking the Tokyo skyline. The walls were all glass, the furniture black and sharp. Hasegawa Makoto was standing by the window, a glass of water in his hand.

电梯门直接在一间极简主义的顶层公寓内开启，俯瞰着东京的天际线。墙壁全由玻璃构成，家具黑亮而锐利。长谷川诚站在窗边，手里端着一杯水。

He didn't turn around when she entered. He didn't need to. He had been watching her progress on a GPS tracker since she left the hotel.

她进来时，他没有回头。他不需要回头。自从她离开酒店，他就一直通过GPS追踪器注视着她的行踪。

"You look tired, Miyetsuko-sama," he said. The honorific felt like a cold blade. "The victory at the academy seems to have cost you more than you expected."

“你看起来很累，美悦子大人，”他说道。那个敬称听起来像一把冰冷的刀锋。“学院的那场胜利，看来让你付出了比预期更多的代价。”

Part 3: The Unfiltered Reality

未经过滤的现实

Miyetsuko dropped the trophy onto the plush rug. "You heard it, didn't you? In the bathroom. You heard what they were doing to Saori."

美悦子将奖杯扔在厚实的地毯上。“你听到了，对吧？在洗手间里。你听到他们对沙织做的事了。”

Makoto finally turned. He walked toward her, his movements fluid and predatory. He reached out and touched the platinum necklace, his fingers brushing the skin he had been monitoring for weeks.

诚终于转过身。他走向她，动作流畅而充满掠食感。他伸手触碰那条铂金项链，手指掠过那片他已监控数周的肌肤。

"I heard the sound of a debt being serviced," he murmured. "Saori understands the mechanics of survival. She is the oil that keeps the Lin family machinery from seizing up. Do you hate her for it? Or do you hate yourself for being the reason she’s on her knees?"

“我听到了债务被偿付的声音，”他低声呢喃，“沙织懂得生存的机制。她是防止林家这台机器瘫痪的润滑油。你因此恨她吗？还是因为自己是她下跪的原因而恨你自己？”

Part 4: The Price of the Savior

救星的价格

Miyetsuko shivered. The logic was cruel, and it was undeniable. She looked at the sprawling city below, feeling utterly small.

美悦子战栗了。这逻辑如此残酷，却又无可辩驳。她看着脚下蔓延的城市，感到从未有过的渺小。

"Why did you call me here?" she whispered.

“你为什么要叫我来这里？”她低声问道。

Makoto leaned in, his scent—clean, cold, and dominant—overpowering her senses. "Because tonight is your first real date. Not as a Lin heiress, and not as a piano prodigy. But as my ward."

诚凑近身子，他身上那股干净、冷冽且强势的气息压倒了她的感官。“因为今晚是你第一次真正的约会。不是作为林家的继承人，也不是作为钢琴天才。而是作为我的监护对象。”

He handed her a simple document. It wasn't about money. It was a transfer of guardianship. "Your father has already agreed to let me 'mentor' you. He thinks I'm helping him secure the next round of funding. He doesn't realize he just handed me the keys to his last fortress."

他递给她一份简单的文件。那无关金钱，而是一份监护权转让书。“你父亲已经同意让我来‘指导’你。他以为我在帮他争取下一轮资金，却没意识到，他刚刚亲手交出了他最后一座堡垒的钥匙。”

Part 5: The Choice

选择

"Sign it," Makoto commanded. "And I will make sure Saori doesn't have to go to the Palace Hotel again tomorrow. I will make the Bai-Feng people vanish from your life."

“签了它，”诚命令道，“我会确保沙织明天不必再去皇宫酒店。我会让白凤基金的人从你的生活中消失。”

Miyetsuko looked at the pen. It was the same one from the van. She thought of Saori’s moans and her father’s desperate laughter. She realized that to save the swan, she had to let the weaver pull the strings.

美悦子看着那支笔。那是车厢里出现过的同一支。她想到沙织的呻吟和父亲绝望的大笑。她意识到，为了救这只天鹅，她必须让织网者拨动琴弦。

She signed. The ink felt like a brand.

她签了字。那墨迹感觉像是一个烙印。

"Good girl," Makoto whispered, taking the paper. "Now, play for me. No Chopin. No audience. Just the sound of your surrender."

“好女孩，”诚接过纸张，低声耳语，“现在，为我弹一曲。不要肖邦，没有观众。只要你投降的声音。”
