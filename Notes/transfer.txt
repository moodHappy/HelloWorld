"Do you ever feel like you're different?" Maya asked nervously.

"Everyone feels that way sometimes," replied Tom, shrugging.

"No, I mean... different like I can do things others can't."

Tom raised an eyebrow. "Like what?"

Maya concentrated on a pencil on the table. It trembled, then lifted into the air.

"Telekinesis?" Tom whispered, eyes wide.

"Since I was a kid," Maya said, lowering the pencil. "I thought I was going crazy."

Tom smiled. "Nope. You're just special."

Maya finally felt understood.
