Chapter 3: The Altar of Retribution

第三集：复仇祭坛

The ruined church waited, silent beneath the humid Rio night. Moonlight cut through broken stained glass, scattering shards of color across cracked stone. Miyetsuko’s robe clung to her like a second skin, damp from the jungle rain, curves highlighted in the moonlight. Every step she took echoed power, control, and anticipation.

废墟教堂静静等待，在闷热的里约夜里无声。月光透过破碎的彩色玻璃，将斑驳的光散落在裂纹的石地上。美悦子的睡袍紧贴肌肤，如第二层皮肤般湿透，曲线在月光下勾勒分明。她每一步都回响着权力、掌控与期待。

Chen Mo followed, silent and precise, his hand brushing the side of her waist as they approached the altar. “Remember,” he whispered, “he sees you as prey. Make him remember who rules.”

陈默紧随其后，动作冷静精准，手轻掠她腰侧。他低语：“记住，他只把你当猎物。让他记住谁才是主宰。”

Miyetsuko’s lips curved, crimson against pale skin. “He’ll remember every sensation… the fear, the desire, the inevitability.” She let her robe slip slightly from one shoulder, exposing a pale, supple curve. Her fingers trailed over Chen Mo’s chest, teasing, possessive. “And you… watch, or taste, or remind me… where the line ends.”

美悦子唇角微翘，鲜红映着苍白肌肤。“他会记住每一种感觉……恐惧、欲望、无可逃避。”她让睡袍从一侧肩膀滑落，露出柔嫩的曲线。手指轻抚陈默胸口，挑逗而占有。“而你……看着，或者感受，或者提醒我……界线在哪。”

They entered the church proper. Shadows twisted across broken pews and scattered relics. The Colombian drug lord, “The Butcher,” waited, flanked by mercenaries, arrogance radiating like heat. Miyetsuko allowed him a heartbeat’s approach, let his gaze roam over her body—then a flick of her wrist, a sudden dagger appearing in her hand.

他们进入教堂内部。阴影在破碎的长椅和散落的遗物间扭曲。哥伦比亚毒枭“屠夫”及其雇佣兵傲然等待，气焰如热浪般扩散。美悦子让他接近一瞬，任他目光在她身上游移——然后手腕一抖，匕首闪现掌中。

“Come closer,” she purred, silk brushing over exposed skin as she moved forward. Her voice was a whip, a lure, a promise. He did, confident, underestimating the predator.

“靠近些，”她轻声诱惑，丝绸滑过裸露肌肤。声音如鞭，如诱饵，如承诺。他靠近，自信，却低估了猎手。

Chen Mo melted into the shadows, sniper rifle aimed, fingers steady. Explosives were set; timing perfect. Every second counted. Miyetsuko danced around her prey, hips swaying, bloodlust hidden behind smiles. She let her robe slip further, exposing long legs, pale skin shining in the moonlight, every movement designed to enthrall and terrorize.

陈默融入暗影，狙击步枪瞄准，手指稳如磐石。炸药已布置，时机完美。每一秒都至关重要。美悦子在猎物周围游走，臀摆摇曳，杀意藏于微笑背后。她让睡袍滑落更多，长腿裸露，苍白肌肤在月光下闪亮，每一个动作既吸引又恐吓。

The first mercenary fell silently, a throat slit. The Butcher’s eyes widened, desire and fear mingling. Miyetsuko pressed closer, her mouth near his ear, whispering about inevitability, control, the sweet rush of surrender. Her hand slid over his chest, tracing his pulse, teasing him into panic.

第一名雇佣兵无声倒下，喉咙被割。屠夫瞳孔放大，欲望与恐惧交织。美悦子靠近，嘴贴耳边，低语关于必然、掌控、屈服的快感。手滑过胸口，探寻脉搏，将他逼入恐慌。

Chen Mo triggered a remote charge, a soft thrum under the floor. The Butcher stumbled, panic flashing in his eyes. Miyetsuko smiled, tilting her head. “Now,” she whispered. With a swift motion, dagger to throat—blood arced in the moonlight.

陈默触发远程炸药，地板下低沉震动。屠夫踉跄，恐慌闪过眼底。美悦子微笑，歪头低语：“现在。”匕首划向喉咙——鲜血在月光下飞溅。

She stepped back, robe clinging to wet skin, crimson streaks across silk. Chen Mo moved forward, collecting weapons, ensuring no loose ends. Miyetsuko’s eyes gleamed—satisfaction, lust, triumph. She leaned close to him, lips brushing his neck. “Rio is mine,” she murmured, voice velvet, deadly. “Every heartbeat, every fear… mine.”

她后退一步，睡袍贴着湿透肌肤，丝绸上血迹斑斑。陈默上前收拾武器，确保无遗漏。美悦子眼中闪烁着——满足、欲望、胜利。她贴近他，唇轻触颈项。“里约属于我，”她低语，声音如丝绒，致命。“每一颗心跳，每一次恐惧……都是我的。”

Outside, Fantasma’s nightclub burned. She had broken his knees, seized his empire, turned a puppet into her servant. Miyetsuko stood atop the balcony, red silk and crimson triumph intertwined, hair plastered to sweat and blood. Rio had learned: the Queen rules with silk, steel, and blood.

窗外，幽灵的夜总会燃烧。她打断他的膝盖，夺取其帝国，将傀儡变为奴仆。美悦子站在阳台之上，红丝绸与鲜血交织，汗水与血水浸湿发丝。里约明白：女王用丝绸、钢铁与鲜血统治。

Chen Mo joined her silently, hands on her waist, lips at her ear. “And the storm continues,” he whispered. She leaned into him, teeth grazing the shell of his ear, her body humming with power and desire. Together, predator and protector, they were unstoppable.

陈默默默走到她身旁，双手环腰，唇贴耳畔低语：“风暴仍在继续。”她靠向他，牙齿轻触耳廓，身体充满力量与欲望。猎手与守护者并肩，他们无法阻挡。
