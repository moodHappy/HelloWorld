Chapter 5: The Bass in the Bones

第五章：骨头里的低音

El Fantasma's villa was built into the cliffside of the Rocinha favela. It was a fortress of concrete and neon, overlooking the slums like a diamond in a pile of coal.

“幽灵”的别墅建在罗西尼亚贫民窟的悬崖边。那是一座由混凝土和霓虹灯构成的堡垒，俯瞰着贫民窟，像煤堆里的一颗钻石。

The bass was so heavy it vibrated in their teeth before they even entered.

低音太重了，还没进门就在牙齿里震动。

BOOM... BOOM... BOOM...

咚……咚……咚……

They walked through the massive iron gates. The air hit them like a physical blow—a mixture of sweat, marijuana, expensive perfume, and roasting meat.

他们穿过巨大的铁门。空气像实体一样撞击着他们——混合着汗水、大麻、昂贵香水和烤肉的味道。

Hundreds of bodies were writhing on the dance floor around the pool. Almost everyone was half-naked. Masks covered faces, but bodies were on full display.

数百具躯体在泳池边的舞池里扭动。几乎所有人都半裸着。面具遮住了脸，但身体一览无余。

"Stay close," Chen Mo whispered, his hand firmly on the small of Miyetsuko's back. His eyes scanned the crowd. He wasn't looking at the naked women; he was looking for bulges under jackets, for earpieces, for eyes that weren't dilated by drugs.

“跟紧我，”陈默低声说，手紧紧扣在美悦子的后腰上。他的眼睛扫描着人群。他没看那些裸女；他在看夹克下的突起，看耳麦，看那些没有被毒品放大的瞳孔。

"Relax, Chen," Miyetsuko shouted over the music. She grabbed a bottle of champagne from a passing waiter and drank straight from the bottle.

“放松点，陈，”美悦子在音乐声中大喊。她从路过的侍应生手里抓过一瓶香槟，直接对瓶吹。

She pulled Chen Mo onto the dance floor.

她把陈默拉进了舞池。

She began to move. It wasn't the polite waltz of Tokyo ballrooms. It was pure, raw instinct. She ground her hips against Chen Mo, the gold chains on her chest swinging violently, slapping against his chest.

她开始扭动。这不是东京舞厅里那种礼貌的华尔兹。这是纯粹、原始的本能。她用臀部研磨着陈默，胸前的金链剧烈摇晃，拍打在陈默的胸口。

"Feel that?" she guided his hand to her chest. The bass was thumping so hard her heart seemed to be beating in sync with the speakers. "I feel alive!"

“感觉到了吗？”她把他的手引向自己的胸口。低音震得太猛，她的心脏似乎在和音响同步跳动。“我感觉活着！”

Chen Mo felt her sweat making her skin slippery. The heat between them was rising, fusing them together in the chaotic crowd. But his other hand was on the grip of his gun under his jacket.

陈默感觉到汗水让她的皮肤变得滑腻。两人之间的热度在升高，在混乱的人群中把他们熔接在一起。但他的另一只手始终按在夹克下枪柄的位置。

He saw a man in a black mask staring at them from the second-floor balcony.

他看到二楼阳台上，一个戴着黑色面具的男人正盯着他们。
