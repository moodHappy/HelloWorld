A Normal Evening

After work, Lucy stopped by the grocery store.
She picked up milk, bread, and a small chocolate bar she didn’t plan to buy.

At home, she kicked off her shoes and sat on the sofa.
The room was quiet, except for the ticking clock.

Her phone buzzed.
A message from her friend: “How was your day?”

Lucy looked at the ceiling for a moment.
Then she typed, “Long, but okay.”

She ate the chocolate slowly, turned on the light, and felt the day finally end.
