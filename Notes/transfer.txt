Chapter 8: The Jungle Law

第八章：丛林法则

Chen Mo was about to pull the trigger when Fantasma burst out laughing.

陈默正要扣动扳机，幽灵却突然爆发出大笑。

"They come to Rocinha? To my bedroom? With ten men?" Fantasma shook his head, looking at the tactical squad below with pity. "Amateurs."

“他们敢来罗西尼亚？来我的卧室？就带十个人？”幽灵摇着头，怜悯地看着下面的战术小队。“业余。”

He whistled. A sharp, piercing sound that cut through the panic.

他吹了一声口哨。一声尖锐、刺耳的哨音切断了恐慌。

Suddenly, the music stopped. But the lights didn't go out. Instead, hundreds of spotlights from the favela hillsides turned on, flooding the villa with blinding white light.

突然，音乐停了。但灯光没有灭。相反，贫民窟山坡上数百盏探照灯同时亮起，将别墅淹没在刺眼的白光中。

On every roof, every balcony, every wall surrounding the villa, silhouettes appeared. Not ten. Not twenty. But hundreds.

在别墅周围的每一个屋顶、每一个阳台、每一堵墙上，都出现了人影。不是十个。不是二十个。而是几百个。

Teenagers in flip-flops holding AK-47s. Grandmothers aiming sniper rifles from laundry lines. The entire favela was Fantasma's army.

穿着人字拖拿着AK-47的少年。在晾衣绳后面架着狙击步枪的老祖母。整个贫民窟都是幽灵的军队。

"Drop the guns," Fantasma ordered into a microphone. "Or become cat food."

“把枪放下，”幽灵对着麦克风命令道。“否则就变成猫粮。”

Kurosaki's elite mercenaries froze. They looked up at the wall of guns pointed at them. They realized their mistake instantly. They had walked into a meat grinder.

黑崎的精英雇佣兵僵住了。他们抬头看着指向他们的枪墙。瞬间意识到了错误。他们走进了一台绞肉机。

Clang. Clang. The weapons hit the floor.

当啷。当啷。武器掉在地板上。

"Good," Fantasma grinned. He pressed a button on his remote. The floor of the dance area opened up. Underneath was a pit. A pit where three more jaguars were waiting, hungry.

“很好，”幽灵咧嘴一笑。他按下了遥控器上的一个按钮。舞池的地板打开了。下面是一个坑。坑里还有三只美洲豹在等待，饥肠辘辘。

"Feeding time!"

“开饭时间！”

The mercenaries were shoved into the pit. The screams were short. The crunching sounds were loud.

雇佣兵被推了下去。尖叫声很短促。咀嚼声很响亮。

Up in the VIP box, Miyetsuko watched. She didn't look away. Her pupils dilated. Her breathing became heavy and ragged. The violence, the raw power, the absolute dominance of the local warlord... it hit her like a drug.

在VIP包厢里，美悦子看着这一切。她没有移开视线。她的瞳孔放大了。呼吸变得沉重而破碎。这种暴力，这种原始的力量，这种地头蛇绝对的统治力……像毒品一样冲击着她。

"Beautiful," she whispered, her hand clutching the gold chains on her chest so tight her knuckles turned white. Her legs clamped together involuntarily.

“太美了，”她低声说，手紧紧抓着胸前的金链，指关节泛白。她的双腿不由自主地夹紧了。
