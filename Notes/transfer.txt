Chapter 28: The Barefoot Queen's Kick

第二十八章：赤脚女王的一踢

They scrambled towards the back window. But one assassin, though burned on his arm, pushed through the flames and lunged at them.

他们手脚并用地爬向后窗。但一个杀手虽然手臂被烧伤，却穿过火焰扑向他们。

He tackled Miyetsuko from behind.

他从背后扑倒了美悦子。

"Get off me!" Miyetsuko screamed.

“滚开！”美悦子尖叫。

The scene was chaotic and violent. The assassin's rough hands grabbed her waist, trying to pin her down. She was only wearing that oversized white shirt. In the struggle, the buttons popped off one by one, revealing large swaths of her snow-white, violently trembling flesh underneath.

场面混乱而暴力。杀手粗糙的大手掐住她的腰，试图把她按住。她只穿了那件过大的白衬衫。在挣扎中，扣子一颗接一颗地崩开，露出下面大片雪白、剧烈颤抖的肉体。

The contrast was shocking—brutal violence against extreme softness.

这种对比是令人震惊的——残酷的暴力对抗极致的柔软。

Chen Mo turned back, his eyes red. He lunged with the fruit knife, stabbing the assassin in the shoulder.

陈默回头，眼睛红了。他拿着水果刀冲上去，扎进了杀手的肩膀。

The assassin roared in pain, loosening his grip slightly.

杀手痛吼一声，手劲松了一点。

Miyetsuko seized the opportunity. She lay on the ground, twisting her body desperately. Then, using her powerful, plump thigh muscles, she delivered a vicious backward kick with her bare foot—straight between the assassin's legs.

美悦子抓住了机会。她躺在地上，拼命扭动身体。然后，利用她那有力、丰腴的大腿肌肉，她光着脚狠狠地向后一蹬——正中杀手的两腿之间。

It was a heavy, solid impact. The sound of something crunching.

那是一记沉重、结实的闷响。有什么东西碎裂的声音。

The assassin's face turned purple, and he collapsed slowly, curling into a prawn shape.

杀手的脸变成了紫色，慢慢倒下，蜷缩成一只虾米。

Miyetsuko scrambled up, gasping for air. Her shirt was practically completely open now, just hanging on her shoulders. Her magnificent chest was heaving violently, covered in a sheen of sweat, glowing in the firelight from the hallway.

美悦子爬起来，大口喘气。她的衬衫现在几乎完全敞开了，挂在肩膀上。她那宏伟的胸膛剧烈起伏，上面覆盖着一层细密的汗珠，在走廊火光的映照下闪着光。

She looked down at the assassin, spat on him, then raised the pistol she hadn't dropped, and calmly put a bullet in his kneecap.

她低头看着那个杀手，啐了一口，然后举起一直没掉落的手枪，冷静地在他的膝盖骨上补了一枪。

"Let's go." She said coldly, stepping over the body with her bare feet.

“走。”她冷冷地说，光着脚跨过了尸体。
