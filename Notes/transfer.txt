Chapter 6: After the Rain

第六章：雨停之后

Birdsong in the morning woke Chen Mo.

清晨的鸟鸣把陈默唤醒。

The rain had stopped, and sunlight rested quietly on the tatami.

雨已经停了，阳光落在榻榻米上。

The space beside him was empty, leaving only a few strands of long hair and a faint scent.

身边的位置已经空了，只剩几根长发和淡淡余香。

A note lay on the table beside an empty can of plum wine.

桌上压着一张便签，旁边是空掉的梅酒罐。

“Thank you for the milk, and for the compliment. I must go back to my life, but now I feel restored. — Lin.”

“谢谢你的牛奶，也谢谢你的赞美。我该回去继续生活了，但现在我已经恢复力气。——林。”

Chen Mo sat in silence, unsure whether the night had been a dream.

陈默坐起身，看着安静的房间，分不清昨夜是否真实。

Yet the memory in his body remained clear.

但身体留下的记忆却无比清楚。

He opened the window and breathed in the cool mountain air.

他推开窗，深吸山间清冷的空气。

There was no promise of meeting again, and no full name left behind.

没有再见的约定，也没有完整的姓名。

He dressed, ate breakfast, and prepared to leave.

他穿好衣服，吃过早餐，准备离开。

The road back to the crowded city was still waiting.

通往喧闹城市的路依旧在那里。

But his steps felt lighter than before.

他的脚步却比来时轻了许多。
