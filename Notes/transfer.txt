The Forgotten Festival

Grandmother would smile as she prepared for the Festival of Lights, a tradition older than anyone could remember.

But as years passed, the lanterns grew dusty in the attic. The special recipes remained uncooked. The songs went unsung.

One day, young Maya found her grandmother's journal describing the celebration. With determination, she gathered the neighborhood children, recreating the forgotten rituals.

As lanterns once again illuminated the night sky, the elders wept, remembering the joy they had neglected.

What was lost to time was found again through the curiosity of a child, proving traditions never truly dieâ€”they just wait to be remembered.
