The rain fell softly as we gathered around the grave. Mother's favorite flowers, white lilies, adorned her casket. I held back tears, remembering her laughter that once filled our home. The priest's words were distant echoes as memories flooded my mindâ€”Sunday breakfasts, bedtime stories, her warm embrace. As the first clump of dirt hit the coffin, reality crashed over me. She was truly gone. My father squeezed my hand, his face etched with grief. Together, we faced the unbearable silence she left behind, knowing life would never be the same without her.
