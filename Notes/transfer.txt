"Ugh, would you just stop with all the questions?" I snapped, rubbing my temples. "I'm trying to fix this computer, not give a tech support seminar."

"But how do you know it's the motherboard?" Mark persisted, leaning closer.

"Because I've been doing this for twenty years, that's how!" I growled, pushing his shoulder away. "Seriously, give it a rest. If you keep bugging me, I might just break it on purpose."

Mark finally backed off, looking slightly offended. "Fine, figure it out yourself, Mr. Grumpy Pants."

And that's how I got my peace and quiet.
