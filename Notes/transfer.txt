The new, politicised meaning of kill line (zhanshaxian) was coined by a Chinese biology student in Seattle. In a series of live streams on Bilibili, a video-blogging app, he claimed to work in a morgue where he had encountered the bodies of homeless people who had frozen outside and gang members felled by violence. Although of dubious veracity, his reflections cast America in the harshest light: a place where a single misfortune—perhaps a car crash or an illness or the loss of a job—can lead to ruin.
