Chapter 12: The Biometric Barrier

第十二章：生物识别的壁垒

Three days later. A high-end customized suit shop in Omotesando.

三天后。表参道一家高级西装定制店。

On the surface, Mrs. Kurosaki was buying a set of decent evening wear for her "little lover." But in the VIP fitting room with the curtains drawn, the atmosphere was tense.

表面上，是黑崎夫人在为她的“小情人”置办一套体面的晚装。但在拉上帘子的VIP试衣间里，气氛却很紧绷。

"I studied the structure of the Logistics Center," Chen Mo stood on the low stool, opening his arms while Miyetsuko measured his waist with a tape measure. He lowered his voice, "The server room requires dual authentication: an IC card and a fingerprint. I can clone the card, but the fingerprint... I can't fake that."

“我研究了物流中心的结构，”陈默站在低矮的凳子上，张开双臂，任由美悦子拿着软尺测量他的腰围。他压低声音，“机房需要双重认证：IC卡和指纹。卡我可以克隆，但指纹……我造不了假。”

Miyetsuko was squatting in front of him, measuring his inseam. Her face was very close to Chen Mo's crotch. Today she wore a deep purple cheongsam-style dress; the high collar made her look dignified, but the excessively tight fit outlined her terrifyingly full curves vividly.

美悦子正蹲在他面前，测量他的裤长。她的脸离陈默的胯部很近。今天她穿了一件深紫色的旗袍式洋装，高领显得端庄，但过分紧致的剪裁将她那恐怖的丰满曲线勾勒得淋漓尽致。

"I have the fingerprint," she said nonchalantly.

“指纹我有。”她漫不经心地说。

"You have it?"

“你有？”

"I stole a whiskey glass he used. I extracted the print and made a silicone film. It's in my bag."

“我偷了一个他用过的威士忌酒杯。提取了指纹，做成了硅胶膜。就在我包里。”

She stood up slowly. As she rose, that heavy, soft sensation inadvertently brushed against Chen Mo's thigh. The friction of the silk fabric sent an electric current straight to his scalp.

她缓缓站起身。起身的过程中，那沉甸甸的柔软感无意间擦过陈默的大腿。丝绸面料的摩擦感，像电流一样直窜他的头皮。

"But there is a new problem," Miyetsuko circled behind Chen Mo, the tape measure tightening around his chest, almost like she was strangling him. "The server room has a weight sensor. Only one person can enter at a time. If the weight changes drastically, the alarm goes off."

“但是有个新问题，”美悦子绕到陈默身后，软尺勒紧了他的胸膛，简直像是在勒死他。“机房有重力感应。一次只能进一个人。如果重量变化剧烈，警报就会响。”

"So I have to go in alone?"

“所以我得一个人进去？”

"No. We go in together." She leaned close to his ear, blowing hot air. "The maintenance window is 15 minutes. The security guard changes shifts every 10 minutes. We have a 5-minute gap. I will distract the guard at the door. You slip in."

“不。我们一起去。”她贴着他的耳朵吹气。“维护窗口只有15分钟。保安每10分钟换岗一次。我们有5分钟的时间差。我会在门口引开保安。你溜进去。”
