The Seed of the Revolutionary Flower

Grandma pressed a small seed into my palm before they took her away. "This is our hope," she whispered. In the barren courtyard where dissent withered, I planted it secretly. Night after night, I watered it with tears of defiance. When the first sprout emerged, its crimson petals seemed to pulse with forbidden words. Others noticed, began tending their own seeds. The authorities tried to pull them out, but the roots had spread too deep. What began as a single seed of rebellion in my hand blossomed into a garden of resistance that could no longer be silenced.
