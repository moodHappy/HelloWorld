Chapter 5: The Golden Spider Web

第五章：金色的蛛网

"The Nest" was quieter than Chen Mo had imagined. There was no deafening music, only the low murmur of jazz cello flowing like mercury near the floor.

“巢穴”比陈默想象中安静。没有震耳欲聋的音乐，只有低沉的爵士大提琴声像水银一样在地板附近流淌。

The air was thick with the scents of aged brandy, expensive cigars, and various complex perfumes mixing together—the smell of money and secrets fermenting. Everyone here wore a perfect mask; their polite nods hid evaluative gazes.

空气里混杂着陈年白兰地、昂贵雪茄和各种复杂香水混合在一起的味道——那是金钱和秘密发酵的气味。这里每个人都戴着完美的面具，礼貌的颔首之后是互相估价的眼神。

Chen Mo, in his off-the-rack suit, felt like a stray dog mingling into a wolf pack's dinner party. He clutched the black card tightly, his palms slightly sweaty.

穿着成衣西装的陈默，觉得自己像是一条混进了狼群晚宴的流浪狗。他紧紧捏着那张黑卡，手心微微出汗。

A waiter wearing white gloves silently appeared in front of him, glancing at the card in his hand with no change in expression.

"Mr. Chen, please follow me. Madam is waiting for you in the 'Orchid Room'."

一个戴着白手套的侍应生无声地出现在他面前，目光扫过他手中的卡片，神色没有丝毫变化。

“陈先生，请跟我来。夫人在‘兰花厅’等您。”

He knew my surname was Chen? She really had investigated him thoroughly.

知道他姓陈？她果然把自己查了个底朝天。

They passed through a long, dimly lit corridor lined with velvet-covered private booths. Sounds of suppressed laughter or intense whispering occasionally leaked from behind heavy curtains. Chen Mo felt like he was walking deeper into a colossal beast's intestine.

穿过一条幽暗的长廊，两侧全是包裹着天鹅绒的私密卡座。厚重的帘幕后偶尔泄露出一两声压抑的笑声，或者激烈的低语。陈默觉得自己正走向一只巨兽的肠道深处。

The waiter stopped in front of a heavily carved wooden door at the very end and pushed it open noiselessly.

"He has arrived."

侍应生在尽头一扇雕花厚木门前停下，无声地推开了门。

“人到了。”
