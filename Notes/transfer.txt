# Where Parallel Lines Meet

So this app popped up yesterday called "CrossPath." Supposedly connects you with parallel versions of yourself. Cool, right? I tried it, and honestly? Mind-blowing at first. Saw me as a rockstar, me as a scientist, even me with a dog instead of my cat.

But then things got freaky. Started seeing my doubles in real life. Like, physically here. At first just glimpses, now they're hanging around my apartment. Claiming they're "me" from other dimensions.

The app keeps saying "lines intersecting" but dude, these parallels aren't meetingâ€”they're taking over. I think my original self is getting... erased. Scariest part? I can't tell which one of us is the original anymore. Or if there even is one anymore.
