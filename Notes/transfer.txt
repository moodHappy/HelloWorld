Chapter 7: The Red Dot on the Gold

第七章：黄金上的红点

The VIP section was a glass box floating above the dance floor. Soundproof, air-conditioned, and filled with white powder on glass tables.

VIP区是悬浮在舞池上方的一个玻璃盒子。隔音，有空调，玻璃桌上堆满了白色粉末。

Fantasma poured tequila. "So, you want to wash 500 million yen? That's a lot of 'paintings'."

幽灵倒了龙舌兰。“所以，你想洗5亿日元？那可是很多‘画’啊。”

"We have high-end clients," Chen Mo sipped the drink, watching the entrance.

“我们有高端客户，”陈默抿了一口酒，盯着入口。

Miyetsuko was sitting on the sofa, petting the jaguar's head which was resting on her lap. The rough tongue of the beast licked the salt and sweat off her knee. It was a bizarre, erotic sight.

美悦子坐在沙发上，抚摸着搁在她腿上的黑豹脑袋。野兽粗糙的舌头舔舐着她膝盖上的盐和汗水。这景象既诡异又色情。

Suddenly, she froze.

突然，她僵住了。

She felt a tiny vibration. Not from the music. But from her own body.

她感觉到了一丝微小的震动。不是来自音乐。而是来自她自己的身体。

She looked down at her chest.

她低头看自己的胸口。

On her left breast, right on the swollen curve exposed by the gold chains, a tiny red laser dot was dancing.

在她的左胸上，就在金链暴露出的那道肿胀弧线上，一个小小的红色激光点正在跳舞。

"Chen," she whispered, not moving her lips. "I'm painted."

“陈，”她低声说，嘴唇没动。“我被锁定了。”

Chen Mo saw it too. The red dot moved from her chest to her forehead.

陈默也看到了。那个红点从她的胸口移向了她的额头。

"Sniper. South ridge," Chen Mo calculated instantly. The glass wall. It was soundproof, but not bulletproof against high-caliber rounds.

“狙击手。南边的山脊，”陈默瞬间计算出方位。玻璃墙。隔音，但挡不住大口径子弹。

"Fantasma! Get down!" Chen Mo tackled the drug lord.

“幽灵！趴下！”陈默扑向毒枭。

CRASH!

哗啦！

The tempered glass wall shattered into a million diamonds. A bullet the size of a finger whizzed past where Fantasma's head had been a second ago, obliterating a bottle of Dom Pérignon.

钢化玻璃墙炸成了一百万颗钻石。一颗手指粗的子弹呼啸着穿过幽灵那一秒钟前脑袋所在的位置，打碎了一瓶唐·培里侬香槟。

"Kurosaki," Miyetsuko rolled off the sofa, pulling the tiny gold gun from her thigh. "He crashed the party."

“黑崎，”美悦子滚下沙发，从大腿上拔出那把金色小枪。“他来砸场子了。”

The carnival music stopped. Screams replaced the bass.

狂欢节音乐停了。尖叫声取代了低音。

"My glass! My champagne!" Fantasma roared, pulling a gold-plated Desert Eagle from his waistband. "Who dares to shoot at El Fantasma?!"

“我的玻璃！我的香槟！”幽灵咆哮着，从裤腰里拔出一把镀金的沙漠之鹰。“谁敢向‘幽灵’开枪？！”

"Our ex-husband," Miyetsuko crawled to the edge of the broken glass, looking down.

“我们的前夫，”美悦子爬到破碎的玻璃边缘，向下看。

Below, in the chaos of the dance floor, ten men in tactical gear were pushing through the crowd, looking up at the VIP box. They weren't dancing. They were hunting.

下面，在混乱的舞池里，十个穿着战术装备的男人正推开人群，抬头看着VIP包厢。他们不是来跳舞的。他们是来狩猎的。
