I was sittin' in my backyard when suddenly, a flock of birds flew over the field. They weren't just any birdsâ€”those were geese! Honking away like they owned the place. I could see their V-formation clearly against the blue sky. 

"What's the big rush?" I muttered to myself, takin' a sip of my lemonade. They were headin' south already, huh? Summer's flyin' by faster than those geese! 

My dog perked up, ears twitching, wonderin' what all the commotion was about. But the birds were just passin' through, no time to stop and chat. Made me kinda wish I could just fly away sometimes, no worries, just followin' the seasons.
