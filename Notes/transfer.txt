The Last Seat

The bus was full, except for one seat beside an old man who smelled faintly of rain. Everyone avoided it.

When Mara finally sat down, he looked relieved. “Thank you,” he said, as if she’d saved him.

They rode in silence until the bus lurched and stopped at a red light. The old man stared out the window, eyes soft. “This is where I get off,” he murmured, though the bus doors stayed closed.

Mara followed his gaze. Outside was an empty field, dark and windless.

She blinked. The seat beside her was empty.

At the next stop, a soaked woman climbed aboard, scanning the bus. When she reached Mara, her face eased. “Is this seat taken?”

Mara smiled, shifting her bag. “No,” she said. “Not anymore.”
