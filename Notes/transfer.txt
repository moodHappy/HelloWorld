Sarah was having a difficult week. Work was stressful, and the rain seemed endless. On her walk home, she noticed a small patch of blue sky peeking through the gray clouds. Just then, a stray cat approached and rubbed against her leg. Sarah knelt down to pet its soft fur, and the cat began to purr contentedly. In that simple moment, with the gentle vibration beneath her hand and the first rays of sunlight warming her face, Sarah felt a wave of peace wash over her. Sometimes, she realized, the smallest joys are the most certain happiness life can offer.
