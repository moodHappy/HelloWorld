The Last Letter

最后的信

She had written it days before, sealing it in an envelope she would never see opened.

她几天前写好了，把信封封好，却永远不会看到它被打开。

The paper smelled faintly of her perfume, a memory she wanted to leave behind.

纸上带着她淡淡的香水味，是她想留下的记忆。

Her handwriting was small, deliberate, controlled—each stroke refusing to tremble.

她的字很小，刻意而稳重——每一笔都拒绝颤抖。

"I am not afraid," she had written.

“我不害怕，”她写道。

She listed people she wanted remembered, things she loved, and the moments that had mattered.

她列出了希望被记住的人、喜欢的事，以及那些重要的瞬间。

She instructed that the letter be read at her funeral, a voice she could no longer lend.

她交代信要在葬礼上念出，这是她无法再借出的声音。

The doctor’s voice echoed in her mind: a schedule, a protocol, a taking away.

医生的声音在她脑中回响：时间表、治疗方案、夺走。

She would not let death have the satisfaction of surprise.

她不会让死亡享受突如其来的快感。

When the priest opened the envelope, hands trembling slightly, the room hushed.

当神父打开信封，手微微颤抖，整个房间沉默下来。

Her words were calm, matter-of-fact, almost like instructions for the living.

她的文字平静、冷静，几乎像是给活着的人留下的指示。

"I chose the way," she wrote. "I chose what I could."

“我选择了方式，”她写道，“我选择了我能选择的。”

For a moment, those listening felt her presence more vividly than ever.

片刻之间，听的人感到她的存在比以往任何时候都更清晰。

And then, the paper was folded, returned to its envelope, and laid into her hands.

随后，纸被折好，放回信封，放入她的手中。

She had spoken her final words, controlled and complete, leaving the rest to those who remained.

她说出了最后的话，掌控且完整，把剩下的交给留下的人。
