Chapter 2: The Appraisal
第二章：估价
The black sedan moved through the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo like a shark in dark water. Miyetsuko sat in the back, squeezed between two silent men. The leather seat was cold against her legs. She clutched her backpack—the only thing they let her take—as if it contained her soul.
黑色轿车在东京雨湿的街道上穿行，像一条在黑水中游弋的鲨鱼。美悦子坐在后座，被两个沉默的男人夹在中间。真皮座椅冰冷地贴着她的双腿。她紧紧抱着她的背包——这是他们唯一允许她带走的东西——仿佛里面装着她的灵魂。
They drove away from the city lights, into the wealthy, secluded hills of Den-en-chōfu. The Kurosaki estate was not just a house; it was a fortress masked as a traditional ryokan. High walls topped with razor wire (hidden by tasteful bamboo) separated the gods from the insects.
车子驶离了城市的灯火，驶入田园调布那些富裕而隐秘的山丘。黑崎庄园不仅仅是一座房子；它是一座伪装成传统日式旅馆的堡垒。高墙顶端布满了刺网（被雅致的竹子遮挡着），将神明与昆虫隔绝开来。
The car stopped. The gates opened.
车停了。大门打开。
"Get out," Tanaka ordered.
“下车，”田中命令道。
Miyetsuko stepped out into the gravel courtyard. The rain was heavier now. A woman was waiting for them under the porch light. She was dressed in a severe, dark kimono. Her hair was pulled back so tight it pulled at her eyes. This was Mrs. Sato, the head housekeeper, the gatekeeper of the inner sanctum.
美悦子踏入碎石铺就的庭院。雨下得更大了。一个女人在门廊的灯光下等候着。她穿着一件严肃的深色和服。头发向后梳得极紧，甚至拉扯着眼角。这是佐藤夫人，女管家，内宅的守门人。
"This is the payment?" Mrs. Sato asked, her voice dry as dead leaves.
“这就是那笔款项？”佐藤夫人问道，声音像枯叶一样干涩。
"Lin's daughter," Tanaka said, lighting a cigarette. "Boss wants her prepped. Immediately."
“林的女儿，”田中说着，点了一支烟。“老板要她准备好。立刻。”
Mrs. Sato walked down the steps and circled Miyetsuko. She didn't look at her face. She looked at her hips, her legs, and finally, her chest. She poked Miyetsuko’s breast with a hard finger, testing the firmness.
佐藤夫人走下台阶，绕着美悦子转了一圈。她没有看她的脸。她看的是她的臀部，她的腿，最后，是她的胸部。她用一根坚硬的手指戳了戳美悦子的乳房，测试着紧实度。
"Ouch..." Miyetsuko flinched.
“疼……”美悦子缩了一下。
"Quiet," Mrs. Sato snapped. "Excessive flesh. Vulgar. But... acceptable for his current mood." She turned to Tanaka. "The Mistress is asleep. Let's keep this quiet. Take her to the East Wing bathhouse."
“闭嘴，”佐藤夫人厉声喝道。“肉太多了。下流。不过……符合他现在的心情。”她转向田中。“夫人已经睡了。动静小点。把她带到东翼的澡堂。”
The East Wing Bathhouse.
东翼澡堂。
The room was tiled in black stone. Steam rose from a large wooden tub. But Miyetsuko wasn't allowed in the tub yet.
房间铺着黑色的石砖。蒸汽从巨大的木桶中升起。但美悦子还没被允许进入浴桶。
"Strip," Mrs. Sato commanded. Two younger maids stood behind her, holding scrubbing brushes and buckets.
“脱，”佐藤夫人命令道。两个年轻的女仆站在她身后，拿着刷子和水桶。
Miyetsuko hesitated. Her hands gripped the hem of her sweatshirt. "Please... I want to go home."
美悦子犹豫了。她的手紧紧抓着卫衣的下摆。“求求你……我想回家。”
"You have no home," Mrs. Sato said, stepping closer. "Your home is seized. Your father is dead. You are property. Do not make me ask twice, or the men outside will come in and strip you. And they won't be gentle."
“你没有家了，”佐藤夫人走近一步。“你的房子被查封了。你父亲死了。你是财产。别让我说第二遍，否则外面的男人会进来帮你脱。他们可不会温柔。”
The threat worked. Trembling, tears mixing with the rain on her face, Miyetsuko pulled off her sweatshirt. Then her jeans. Then her underwear.
威胁奏效了。颤抖着，泪水混合着脸上的雨水，美悦子脱下了卫衣。然后是牛仔裤。然后是内衣。
When the last piece of fabric fell, the maids audibly gasped.
当最后一片布料落下时，女仆们发出了清晰的吸气声。
Miyetsuko stood naked under the harsh lights. Her body was a masterpiece of contradiction. Her waist was narrow, her limbs slender, almost fragile. But her breasts were overwhelmingly large, heavy, and pale. They hung with a weight that seemed to defy gravity, the large, pink areolas stiffening in the cool air. They were bodies of their own, demanding attention.
美悦子赤裸地站在刺眼的灯光下。她的身体是一个矛盾的杰作。她的腰很细，四肢修长，几乎有些脆弱。但她的乳房却大得惊人，沉重而苍白。它们带着似乎要对抗地心引力的重量垂坠着，巨大的粉色乳晕在冷空气中挺立。它们仿佛有自己的生命，强行索取着注视。
"Monstrous," Mrs. Sato muttered, her eyes narrowing with a mix of disgust and jealousy. "Like a dairy cow."
“怪物，”佐藤夫人低声嘟囔，眼睛眯起，混杂着厌恶和嫉妒。“像头奶牛。”
She snapped her fingers. "Scrub her. Every inch. Under the nails. Between the toes. Inside the ears. And... inside there too. He hates dirt."
她打了个响指。“刷洗她。每一寸。指甲缝。脚趾间。耳廓里。还有……那个里面也要洗。他讨厌脏东西。”
The maids moved in. It wasn't a bath; it was a car wash. They used rough sponges. They scrubbed her skin until it was raw and red. Miyetsuko tried to cover her chest with her arms, but they slapped her hands away.
女仆们围了上来。这不仅是洗澡，这是洗车。她们用粗糙的海绵。她们擦洗她的皮肤直到红肿刺痛。美悦子试图用手臂遮住胸部，但被她们把手打掉了。
"Open your legs," one maid said, holding a douche nozzle.
“张开腿，”一个女仆拿着灌洗喷头说。
"No..." Miyetsuko backed away, slipping on the wet tiles.
“不……”美悦子向后退，在湿瓷砖上滑了一下。
Mrs. Sato grabbed her hair, forcing her head back. "Listen to me, girl. You are about to meet Kurosaki Soichiro. If you smell like fear or sweat, he will break you before he even fucks you. We are saving your life."
佐藤夫人抓住她的头发，强迫她仰起头。“听着，丫头。你马上就要见黑崎宗一郎了。如果你闻起来有恐惧或汗水的味道，他在干你之前就会打断你的骨头。我们这是在救你的命。”
Miyetsuko sobbed, defeated. She spread her legs. The cold water invaded her. The humiliation was total.
美悦子啜泣着，崩溃了。她张开了腿。冷水侵入了她。羞耻感是彻底的。
Thirty minutes later.
三十分钟后。
She was dried, perfumed with a scent of sandalwood and jasmine. Her long black hair was brushed until it shone like silk.
她被擦干，喷上了檀香和茉莉花的香水。她黑色的长发被梳理得像丝绸一样发亮。
They brought out a white kimono. A Shiromuku. The traditional wedding kimono.
她们拿出一件白色和服。一件白无垢。传统的婚礼和服。
"A bride?" Miyetsuko asked, her voice hoarse. A tiny spark of hope? Or confusion?
“新娘？”美悦子问道，声音嘶哑。是一丝希望？还是困惑？
Mrs. Sato laughed. It was a cold, sharp sound.
佐藤夫人笑了。那是一个冰冷、尖锐的声音。
"Do not misunderstand. You are not marrying him. This is just... packaging. He likes to unwrap things. He likes to spoil purity."
“别误会。你不是要嫁给他。这只是……包装。他喜欢拆礼物。他喜欢玷污纯洁。”
They dressed her. They wrapped the obi tight, cinching her waist. But they left the top slightly loose, so that her massive breasts pushed against the silk, threatening to burst out with every breath. It was designed to look like she was bursting out of her own modesty.
她们给她穿上衣服。她们把腰带束得很紧，勒细她的腰。但她们把上身留得稍微宽松，这样她巨大的乳房就挤压着丝绸，仿佛每一次呼吸都要爆裂出来。这是精心设计的，让她看起来像是要把自己的端庄撑破一样。
Mrs. Sato stepped back and admired the work.
佐藤夫人退后一步，欣赏着这件作品。
"He will tear it within minutes," she noted casually. "A waste of good silk. But the debt must be paid."
“他几分钟内就会把它撕碎，”她随口说道。“浪费了好丝绸。但债必须得还。”
She grabbed Miyetsuko’s chin.
她抓住美悦子的下巴。
"Go to the chamber at the end of the hall. Kneel on the pillow. Do not speak unless spoken to. Do not look him in the eye unless he commands it. And whatever he does... do not bite."
“去走廊尽头的那个房间。跪在枕头上。除非他问话，否则不许出声。除非他命令，否则不许直视他的眼睛。不管他做什么……绝对不许咬。”
Miyetsuko was pushed out into the dark hallway. The wooden floor creaked beneath her white tabi socks. The house was silent, a sleeping beast waiting to wake up.
美悦子被推到了黑暗的走廊里。木地板在她白色的足袋下吱呀作响。房子静悄悄的，像一头沉睡的野兽等待苏醒。
She walked towards the door at the end. Towards Chapter 37. Towards the box.
她走向尽头的那扇门。走向第三十七章。走向那个盒子。
