Chapter 23: The Temperature of a Truce

第二十三章：休战的温度

The morning sun of Tokyo filtered through the blinds, slicing the gray concrete room into strips of light and shadow. The air was thick with the scent of whiskey, sweat, and the unique musk of a night of indulgence.

东京的晨光透过百叶窗，把灰色的混凝土房间切成一道道光影。空气里弥漫着威士忌、汗水和一夜放纵后特有的麝香味。

Chen Mo woke up first. He turned his head and saw the woman lying beside him.

陈默先醒了。他转过头，看着躺在身边的女人。

Miyetsuko was deep asleep. Without her heavy makeup and her armor-like haute couture, she looked... dangerously soft. Her black hair was spread across the pillow like seaweed. The white silk sheet barely covered her hips, exposing a large expanse of her back.

美悦子睡得很沉。卸去了浓妆和铠甲般的高定礼服，她看起来……危险地柔软。黑发像海藻一样散落在枕头上。白色的丝绸床单勉强盖住她的臀部，露出一大片光洁的背脊。

It was a back made of cream and jade—plump, smooth, with a shallow groove running down her spine that disappeared into the shadows of the sheets. Chen Mo reached out and gently traced that curve. The flesh under his fingertips was warm and elastic, like dough that had finished rising.

那是奶油和玉石堆砌而成的背脊——丰腴、光滑，脊椎处有一道浅浅的沟壑，消失在床单的阴影里。陈默伸出手，轻轻沿着那条曲线划过。指尖下的皮肉温热、富有弹性，像发酵完成的面团。

"Don't stop..." Her sleepy, hoarse voice suddenly murmured. She didn't open her eyes, but her body arched slightly like a cat, pressing her back firmly against Chen Mo's hand.

“别停……”她带着睡意和沙哑的声音突然响起。她没睁眼，身体却像猫一样微微拱起，把背脊更用力地贴向陈默的手掌。

"I thought Queens didn't sleep in," Chen Mo teased, his hand sliding down to rest on her heavy, soft waist.

“我以为女王是不赖床的。”陈默调侃道，手滑下去，停在她那沉甸甸、软绵绵的腰侧。

"The Queen is tired. Her Knight was too rough last night." Miyetsuko turned over, the sheet slipping off completely.

“女王累了。她的骑士昨晚太粗鲁了。”美悦子翻过身，床单彻底滑落。

The morning light hit her front. The visual impact was violent. The red marks Chen Mo had left on her snow-white skin last night were like blooming plum blossoms on snow—vivid evidence of conquest.

晨光打在她身前。视觉冲击力是暴力的。昨晚陈默在她雪白皮肤上留下的红痕，像雪地里盛开的梅花——那是鲜明的征服证据。

She opened her eyes, lazily looking at Chen Mo, a satisfied smile curling her lips.

她睁开眼，慵懒地看着陈默，嘴角勾起一抹餍足的笑。

"But I like it. Pain makes me feel alive." She pulled Chen Mo's neck down and bit his lip. "Now, get up. The war starts in an hour. I want coffee."

“但我喜欢。疼痛让我觉得活着。”她拉下陈默的脖子，咬了一口他的嘴唇。“现在，起床。战争一小时后开始。我要咖啡。”
