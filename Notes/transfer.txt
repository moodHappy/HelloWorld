Title: The Call

The old man’s phone rang just after midnight. A weak voice whispered:

"Don’t go out tomorrow. Please, just stay home."

Before he could reply, the line went dead.

The next day, uneasy but obedient, he stayed inside. Hours later, news broke: a bus had crashed downtown—on the very route he took every morning.

Relieved, he set the phone down… then froze. The call history showed no record of any incoming call.

And the phone hadn’t worked in years.
