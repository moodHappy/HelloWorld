Title: The Last Message

Liam found an old phone buried in the attic. It had one unread message:

"Don’t forget to be kind today."

He didn’t recognize the sender, but he smiled. That day, he held the door for strangers, thanked the bus driver, and called his mother.

Years later, he discovered the phone belonged to his younger self—set to send reminders he would one day forget.

Sometimes, kindness is just a memory waiting to be remembered.

如果你愿意，我可以再写一篇 带一点悬疑反转 的微小说，让结尾令人意想不到。
