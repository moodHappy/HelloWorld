When Wang's mother demanded the traditional white cloth test, Li Mei countered with a demand of her own: 300,000 yuan bride price. Not a penny less!

"Magic defeats magic," Wang thought, watching the standoff.

Suddenly, his mom hugged him, "Don't worry, my precious boy! Mama will protect you!"

Wang, the ultimate mama's boy, beamed. His safety secured, he announced: "No virginity test, but also no bride price!"

Both women stared, speechless. Sometimes, the best negotiation tactic is having a mama's boy who just wants everyone to get along. The wedding was back onâ€”simple, cheap, and hilariously untraditional.
