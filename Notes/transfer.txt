# Driving to Work in a Heavy Rainstorm

Man, was that drive something else this morning! The rain was coming down buckets, and I could barely see the road in front of me. My wipers were going full speed, but they weren't helping much. Cars were splashing water everywhere, and I was white-knuckling the steering wheel. I kept thinking, "Why didn't I just call in sick?" But nope, had to get to that meeting. Made it finally, soaked to the bone, but hey, at least I wasn't late! Boss didn't even notice I looked like a drowned rat. Still, maybe I'll check the weather before heading out tomorrow!
