# The Portal Paradox

In 2157, scientists discovered a portal to another dimension. Dr. Elena Chen led the team through the shimmering gateway. Instead of a parallel Earth, they found a realm where magic existed with advanced technology.

Elves with cybernetic implants greeted them. "Welcome to Aethel," said an elf whose eyes glowed blue. "We've been expecting you."

The team's communicators transformed into wands. Elena realized their science was magic here. As they returned, Elena wondered: had they brought magic back, or had Earth always possessed it?
