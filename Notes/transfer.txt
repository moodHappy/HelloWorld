# Strange Events

The town of Millfield hadn't experienced anything unusual in decades. That changed last Tuesday. Morning dew formed intricate patterns on cars, spelling words no one could read. Birds flew in perfect geometric formations across the sky. The strangest occurrence was at the old clock tower, which began running backward. People whispered about parallel dimensions colliding. Scientists were baffled. By Friday, everything returned to normal. No one could explain the strange events, and soon they became just another local mystery, fading like mist in the morning sun.
