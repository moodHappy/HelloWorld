Chapter 7: The Gilded Routine

第七章：镀金的日常

Part 1: The Return

归家

Miyetsuko walked back through the front gates of the Lin estate at dawn. The rain had stopped, but the air was still damp. Her father was sitting in the living room, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He didn't ask where she had been.

黎明时分，美悦子走回了林家大门。雨停了，空气依然潮湿。父亲坐在客厅里，手里拿着一杯威士忌。他没有问她去了哪里。

"The Kurosaki boy is gone," he said, his voice flat. "It’s a setback, but we have breathing room. Get dressed for school. We have appearances to maintain."

“黑崎家的儿子没了，”他声音平淡，“这是个挫折，但我们有了喘息的空间。换衣服去学校，我们要维持体面。”

He was already looking at a list of names on his tablet. New potential investors. New buyers. To him, the crash was just a market adjustment.

他已经在平板电脑上看一份名单了。新的潜在投资者，新的买家。对他来说，那场车祸仅仅是一次市场调整。

Part 2: Back to St. Cecilia’s

回到学院

The halls of St. Cecilia’s Academy were as silent and polished as ever. Miyetsuko walked with her head high, her uniform crisp. She acted as if the previous night’s breakdown had never happened.

圣塞西莉亚学院的走廊一如既往地安静且光亮。美悦子挺胸抬头地走着，校服笔挺。她表现得仿佛昨晚的崩溃从未发生过。

The other girls whispered as she passed. They had seen the news about the Kurosaki heir. Some looked at her with envy, others with suspicion. Eriko stood by the lockers, watching her with a cold, knowing smile.

她经过时，其他女孩在窃窃私语。她们都看到了黑崎继承人的新闻。有人嫉妒，有人怀疑。绘里子站在储物柜旁，带着冷淡而了然的微笑看着她。

"Lucky escape, Miyetsuko," Eriko said as they crossed paths. "But a swan without a lake is just a bird in the dirt. How long can your father keep the lights on?"

“逃过一劫啊，美悦子，”擦肩而过时，绘里子说道。“但没有湖泊的天鹅只是泥土里的鸟。你父亲还能撑多久？”

Part 3: The Grand Ceremony

盛大仪式

The school announced a grand ceremony for the afternoon. It was a formal event to celebrate all the students who had recently reached their 18th year. For the elite, this was more than a birthday; it was a debut into the adult world of contracts and power.

学校宣布下午将举行盛大的仪式。这是一场正式活动，旨在庆祝所有近期满18岁的学生。对于精英阶层来说，这不只是个生日，而是正式进入由契约和权力构成的成人世界。

The auditorium was decorated in white and gold. Hundreds of students sat in rows, wearing ceremonial sashes. Miyetsuko was seated in the front row, the center of attention.

礼堂布置成白金两色。数百名学生系着礼仪缎带成排而坐。美悦子坐在第一排，是全场的焦点。

"You are the future of our society," the principal said from the stage. "Today, you take your place as adults."

“你们是我们社会的未来，”校长在台上说道，“今天，你们正式步入成人的行列。”

Part 4: The Observer in the Wings

侧幕的观察者

Mikage Saori stood in the shadows behind the stage, acting as a chaperone. She watched Miyetsuko with a blank expression. Her own uniform was perfect, her neck covered by a high collar to hide the bruises from the night before.

御影沙织站在舞台后的阴影里，履行随行导师的职责。她面无表情地看着美悦子。她的制服很完美，高领遮住了颈部，掩盖了昨晚留下的淤青。

In the back of the auditorium, a man in a dark suit stood by the exit. It was Hasegawa Makoto. He wasn't a guest, but no one asked him to leave. He leaned against the wall, watching the ceremony through a pair of light-colored glasses.

礼堂后方，一名穿着深色西装的男人站在出口处。是长谷川诚。他不是宾客，但没人请他离开。他靠在墙上，透过一副浅色眼镜注视着仪式。

He adjusted a small earpiece. Through the micro-transmitter in Miyetsuko’s necklace, he could hear her rapid heartbeat echoing the rhythm of the school anthem. She looked like a queen, but to him, she was just a countdown.

他调整了一下微型耳机。通过美悦子项链里的发射器，他能听到她急促的心跳正呼应着校歌的节奏。她看起来像个女王，但在他眼里，她只是一个倒计时。
