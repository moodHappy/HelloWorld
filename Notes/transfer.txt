My pregnant wife went for her ultrasound today. After the scan, she excitedly asked the doctor, "So, am I having a little prince or a little princess?" The doctor looked at her with a completely straight face and calmly replied, "Commoner." My wife's jaw just dropped! I had to turn away to hide my laughter. The doctor continued typing on his computer like he'd just commented on the weather. We left the office still wondering if we're having a boy or girl, but definitely knowing we're not royalty! Guess our baby will have to work for the throne like everyone else.
