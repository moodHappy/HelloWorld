Chapter 29: Transparent Shinjuku

第二十九章：透明的新宿

They climbed down the fire escape and tumbled into the back alley of Shinjuku. It was still raining hard.

他们爬下防火梯，跌跌撞撞地进了新宿的后巷。雨依然下得很大。

They ran. They ran desperately through the neon-lit, crowded streets. They blended into the sea of umbrellas, becoming two drops of water in the ocean of Tokyo.

他们跑。拼命地跑过霓虹闪烁、拥挤不堪的街道。他们混入伞的海洋，变成东京这片大海里的两滴水。
The adrenaline rush began to fade, replaced by exhaustion and the bone-deep cold of the rain.

肾上腺素的狂潮开始退去，取而代之的是疲惫和雨水带来的刺骨寒意。

Miyetsuko was barefoot. Her white shirt was completely soaked, clinging transparently to her skin. It was no longer clothing; it was a second skin that highlighted every detail.

美悦子光着脚。她的白衬衫完全湿透了，透明地贴在皮肤上。那不再是衣服，而是第二层皮肤，强调着每一个细节。

The dark aureoles of her nipples were clearly visible, hardened by the cold rain and excitement, pushing against the wet fabric. The massive weight of her breasts bounced with every step she took, a burdensome yet mesmerizing sight in the neon reflections. Raindrops slid down her neck, pooling in the deep valley between her breasts before soaking into the fabric below.

她乳晕的深色清晰可见，因为冷雨和兴奋而挺立着，顶着湿漉漉的布料。她胸前巨大的重量随着她每一步跑动而颠簸，在霓虹灯的倒影中，这是一种累赘却又令人着迷的景象。雨滴顺着她的脖子滑落，汇聚在她胸间深邃的山谷里，然后浸透下方的布料。

Passersby cast surprised glances. A barefoot woman in a wet, transparent shirt, running with a man in a torn suit. They looked like a pair of desperate lovers fleeing a crime scene.

路人投来惊讶的目光。一个光着脚、穿着湿透透明衬衫的女人，和一个穿着破烂西装的男人在奔跑。他们看起来像是一对逃离犯罪现场的亡命鸳鸯。

Which, in a way, they were.

从某种意义上说，他们确实是。

"In here." Chen Mo pulled her into a narrow alley behind a pachinko parlor.

“这边。”陈默把她拉进一家弹子房后面的狭窄小巷。

At the end of the alley flashed a sleazy pink neon sign: "Hotel Mermaid - Rest 2000 Yen, Stay 5000 Yen.
" A cheap love hotel. The perfect hiding place.

小巷尽头闪烁着低俗的粉色霓虹灯牌：“人鱼旅馆——休息2000日元，住宿5000日元。” 一家廉价的情人旅馆。完美的藏身之处。
