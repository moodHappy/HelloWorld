Gregor awoke to find his apartment number had changed overnight. The familiar "4B" now read "âˆž" in brass letters. When he tried to leave for work, the hallway stretched endlessly, doors multiplying along its length.

Gregor's phone rang, but the voice on the other end was his own, explaining that he had been terminated for failure to exist in the proper dimension. As he sat down, his chair dissolved into bureaucracy.
