As I went about my daily routine, I felt a sense of comfort in the mundane tasks. Every morning, I'd wake up at 6, exercise, and then head to the kitchen to cook breakfast. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, and the sound of sizzling eggs was music to my ears. After a simple yet satisfying meal, I'd tidy up the house, feeling a sense of accomplishment as I saw the tidy living room. In these everyday moments, I found peace, a respite from the chaos of the world outside. Routine brought me serenity.
