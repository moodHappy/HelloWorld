Chapter 64: The City Beneath Their Feet

第六十四章：脚下的城市

Inside the cabin, it was quiet except for the hum of the engine.

机舱里，除了引擎的嗡嗡声，一片安静。

Miyetsuko lay on the floor, breathless. Her dress was in tatters. Her feet were bleeding. She was covered in grease, sweat, and gunpowder.

美悦子躺在地板上，喘不过气。她的裙子成了碎布条。脚在流血。满身是油污、汗水和火药。

But she was laughing.

但她在笑。

She crawled over to the window and looked down. Tokyo spread out below them like a circuit board on fire. The police sirens were just silent red and blue lights from this height.

她爬到窗边向下看。东京在他们脚下铺开，像一块燃烧的电路板。在这个高度，警笛声只是无声的红蓝光点。

"Look at it, Chen," she whispered, pressing her hand against the glass. "It's so small from up here. Kurosaki, Mishima... they are just ants fighting over a crumb."

“看啊，陈，”她低声说，手按在玻璃上。“从这上面看，它是这么小。黑崎，三岛……他们只是争夺面包屑的蚂蚁。”

Chen Mo sat beside her. He took off his tuxedo jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders.

陈默坐在她身边。脱下礼服外套，披在她肩上。

"We are free," he said.

“我们自由了，”他说。

"For now," Miyetsuko turned to him. Her eyes were bright, reflecting the city lights. "But freedom is boring, Chen. I don't want to just lay on a beach in Rio."

“暂时的，”美悦子转向他。她的眼睛很亮，反射着城市的光。“但自由很无聊，陈。我不想只是在里约的海滩上躺着。”

"What do you want?"

“那你想要什么？”

She reached out, grabbing his tie and pulling him down for a kiss.

她伸出手，抓住他的领带，把他拉下来接吻。

"I want to build our own Kingdom. With the 500 million... and your brain... and my cruelty."

“我想建立我们自己的王国。用那5亿……加上你的脑子……和我的残忍。”

She smiled, the most dangerous and beautiful smile he had ever seen.

她笑了，那是他见过的最危险、最美丽的笑容。

"But first... ask the pilot if this thing has a autopilot. I need to celebrate."

“但首先……问问飞行员这玩意儿有没有自动驾驶。我需要庆祝一下。”

Chen Mo looked at the mercenary pilot, who smartly put on noise-canceling headphones and stared strictly forward.

陈默看了看那个佣兵飞行员，后者识趣地戴上了降噪耳机，死死盯着前方。

Chen Mo turned back to his Queen.

陈默转回身看着他的女王。

"Autopilot engaged."

“自动驾驶已启动。”

As the helicopter flew towards the sunrise, high above the chaotic world, they began their own private, violent, and passionate celebration in the sky.

当直升机飞向日出，高悬在混乱的世界之上时，他们在空中开始了属于他们私人的、暴力的、充满激情的庆祝。
