Chapter 17: The Back of the Trophy

第十七章：奖杯的背面

Part 1: The Simple Dream

单纯的愿望

Behind the velvet curtains, the roar of the crowd felt like a distant ocean. Miyetsuko clutched the gold trophy, her knuckles white. Ayaka was already there, bouncing on the balls of her feet, her eyes shining with genuine pride.

丝绒幕布后，观众的欢呼声如远处的潮汐。美悦子紧握着金奖杯，指节发白。绫香已经在那里了，兴奋地跳着脚，眼中闪烁着由衷的自豪。

"We have to celebrate!" Ayaka laughed, grabbing Miyetsuko’s free hand. "There’s a ramen shop near the station that stays open late. My treat. No silk, no cameras, just extra pork slices."

“我们一定要庆祝一下！”绫香笑着抓起美悦子空着的那只手。“车站附近有一家开到很晚的拉面店。我请客。没有丝绸，没有镜头，只有加量的叉烧。”

For a fleeting second, Miyetsuko felt like a normal eighteen-year-old. The idea of salt, steam, and cheap wooden chopsticks felt more luxurious than any gala. "I’d like that," she whispered. "I’d really like that."

在那转瞬即逝的一秒钟里，美悦子觉得自已像个普通的十八岁女孩。那关于咸味、蒸汽和廉价木筷的念头，听起来比任何盛宴都要奢侈。“我想去，”她轻声说，“我真的很想去。”

Part 2: The Golden Handcuff

黄金手铐

The dream shattered as the stage door swung open. Mr. Lin marched in, followed by two security guards. He didn't look at his daughter’s face; he looked at the trophy in her hand as if it were a bank statement.

舞台门被推开，梦境随之破碎。林先生大步走入，身后跟着两名保安。他没有看女儿的脸，而是盯着她手里的奖杯，仿佛那是某种银行对账单。

"Excellent work, Miyetsuko. This win is perfectly timed," he said, checking his gold Rolex. "The car is waiting. The Chairman of the Bai-Feng Group is hosting a dinner in your honor at the Palace Hotel."

“做得好，美悦子。这次获胜的时机非常完美，”他说着，看了一眼金劳力士。“车在外面等着。白凤集团的董事长正在皇宫酒店为你举办荣誉晚宴。”

Miyetsuko hesitated, her hand slipping from Ayaka’s grip. "Father, I... I promised Ayaka—"

美悦子迟疑了，手从绫香的掌心中滑落。“父亲，我……我答应了绫香——”

Mr. Lin didn't even look at Ayaka. To him, she was part of the background, as invisible as the dust on the piano. "Don't be childish. This isn't a party; it’s an introduction. Ayaka-san can find her own way home."

林先生连看都没看绫香一眼。对他而言，她只是背景的一部分，和钢琴上的灰尘一样无形。“别孩子气了。这不是聚会，这是引荐。佐藤小姐可以自己回家。”

Part 3: The Scent of Sacrifice

牺牲的气息

The black Mercedes felt like a mobile tomb. As they drove toward the Palace Hotel, Saori sat in the front seat next to the driver. She was perfectly still, her back stiff against the leather.

黑色奔驰车感觉像一座移动的坟墓。在前往皇宫酒店的途中，沙织坐在司机旁的副驾驶位。她纹丝不动，背部僵硬地抵着皮革座椅。

Miyetsuko leaned forward, her voice low. "Saori, are you... are you alright?"

美悦子向前倾身，低声问道：“沙织，你……你还好吗？”

Saori didn't turn around. Through the rearview mirror, Miyetsuko saw her eyes—hollow, dark, and utterly vacant. A faint, cloying scent of heavy cologne and expensive cigar smoke still clung to her hair, a ghost of the Hakone retreat.

沙织没有回头。通过后视镜，美悦子看到了她的眼睛——空洞、黯淡、完全没有任何神采。一股淡淡的、令人作呕的高级古龙水和名贵雪茄烟味仍缠绕在她的发丝间，那是箱根度假村留下的幽灵。

"I am functioning as required, Miyetsuko-sama," Saori replied. Her voice was a dry reed. "Please focus on your posture. The Chairman expects a perfect swan."

“我正在按要求履行职责，美悦子大人，”沙织回答，声音如干枯的芦苇。“请注意你的仪态。董事长期待的是一只完美的天鹅。”

Part 4: The Vultures' Gala

秃鹫的盛宴

The private dining room at the Palace Hotel was a sea of white linen and predatory smiles. Masato Bai-Feng stood at the head of the table. When he saw Miyetsuko enter, his eyes swept over her with a terrifying familiarity.

皇宫酒店的私人包间里是一片白亚麻布和掠食者般的微笑。白凤雅人站在桌首。当他看到美悦子走进来时，他的目光带着一种令人恐惧的熟稔感扫过她的全身。

"The champion arrives," Masato purred, extending a hand. "Beauty and talent. A rare combination in such a desperate market."

“冠军驾到，”雅人轻声说，伸出一只手。“美貌与才华。在如此绝望的市场中，这真是罕见的组合。”

As Miyetsuko took his hand, she felt a cold shiver. The way he looked at her was identical to the way the gateman had looked at Saori in the shadows of the night. She wasn't a guest of honor; she was the main course.

当美悦子握住他的手时，她感到一阵恶寒。他看她的眼神，与那个门房在深夜阴影里看沙织的眼神如出一辙。她不是贵宾，她是主菜。

Part 5: The Silent Observation

无声的观察

In the darkness of a parked van outside the hotel, Hasegawa Makoto watched the live feed from the micro-camera hidden in the room’s floral arrangement. He saw Masato’s hand linger too long on Miyetsuko’s waist.

酒店外一辆停着的厢式车暗处，长谷川诚正盯着房间花艺中隐藏的微型摄像机传来的实时画面。他看到雅人的手在美悦子的腰间停留了太久。

He adjusted his headset, listening to the clink of crystal and the low, dirty jokes being traded under the cover of polite conversation.

他调整了一下耳机，听着水晶杯的碰撞声，以及掩盖在礼貌谈话下的下流笑话。

"The swan is learning that the gold of her trophy is just a thin plating over lead," Makoto whispered. He picked up his phone and sent a single text to Miyetsuko.

“天鹅正在意识到，她奖杯上的金光只是铅块上一层薄薄的镀层，”诚低声呢喃。他拿起手机，给美悦子发了一条短信。

On Miyetsuko’s lap, hidden by the tablecloth, her phone buzzed.

美悦子的膝头上，在桌布的遮掩下，手机震动了一下。

Check your neck. The leash is getting tighter.

摸摸你的脖子。锁链正在收紧。
