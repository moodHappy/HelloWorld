The rain lashed against the cottage window in Wales, where I'd hidden for twenty-one years. Twenty-one years since the FBI put my face on every post office wall. They called me an extremist, a terrorist. I preferred to call myself a voice for the voicelessâ€”the animals suffering in those research facilities.

The knock on my door wasn't unexpected, but still it startled me. The handcuffs felt cold, familiar. As they led me away, I wondered if my silence had made any difference at all. Sometimes, even the most passionate voices are lost to time.
