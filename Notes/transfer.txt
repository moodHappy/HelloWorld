The fireworks painted the night sky, each burst scattering colors across Emma’s face as we sat on the grass. She leaned close and whispered, “I wish summer could stay like this forever.” I smiled, though a part of me knew forever was too much to ask.  

<i>烟花点亮夜空，绚烂的光彩映在艾玛的脸上，我们并肩坐在草地上。她靠过来低声说：“我真希望夏天能永远这样下去。”我笑了，可心里明白，永远只是奢望。</i>

When the final sparks faded, the crowd began to leave. Emma brushed the grass from her skirt and said quietly, “I have to go tomorrow.” My heart sank—until she added, with a small grin, “But only for a week. Don’t forget me.”  

<i>当最后的火光消散，人群开始散去。艾玛拍了拍裙子上的草，轻声说：“我明天就要走了。”我心头一沉——直到她笑着补充，“只是一个星期，别忘了我。”</i>

Relief flooded me as the night grew silent. Summer wasn’t over yet—at least not for us.  

<i>夜色渐静，我心中涌起释然。夏天还没有结束——至少，对我们而言。</i>
