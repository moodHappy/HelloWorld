Used to be, a buck bought you coffee. Now? Man, inflation's gone wild. Yesterday, bread cost a grand. Today? Two. Tomorrow? Who knows. My wallet's just useless paper. People trade cigarettes or batteries instead. Government says "stay calm," but prices jump every hour. Saw a guy get mugged for a can of beans. Beans! Used to throw that stuff out. Now it's gold. My savings? Gone. Poof. Just like that. We're all running in place, getting poorer while numbers climb. This ain't living. Just surviving until the next price hike. What's the point anymore?
