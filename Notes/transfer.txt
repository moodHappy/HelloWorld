Chapter 6: The Distance of a Necklace

第六章：一条项链的距离

The room was dimly lit, with only a spotlight focused on the high-back leather sofa in the center.

房间里光线昏暗，只有一束射灯聚焦在中央的高背皮质沙发上。

She sat there, holding a cigarette holder between her fingers, smoke curling leisurely.

她坐在那里，指尖夹着一支烟嘴，烟雾袅袅上升。

She was no longer the gentle woman in the cotton yukata who needed comfort on a rainy night. The woman before him was armor-clad.

她不再是那个雨夜里需要慰藉的、穿着棉布浴衣的温柔女人了。眼前的女人，全副武装。

A perfectly cut black silk dress wrapped tightly around her body like a second skin. The fabric's sheen highlighted those majestic, undulating curves that Chen Mo couldn't forget—they now looked aggressive, like towering peaks declaring power to the world.

一件剪裁完美的黑色丝绸长裙像第二层皮肤一样紧紧包裹着她的身体。布料的光泽勾勒出陈默无法忘怀的那道宏伟起伏——它们现在看起来充满了攻击性，像是两座向世界宣告权力的山峰。

Her hair was combed back meticulously, revealing a smooth, cold forehead. On her neck hung a diamond necklace that almost blinded Chen Mo. The cold brilliance of the gems formed a sharp contrast with the expansive, warm snow-white skin below it.

头发一丝不苟地向后梳起，露出光洁冷漠的额头。脖子上挂着一条几乎晃瞎陈默眼睛的钻石项链。宝石冰冷的光芒，与它下方那片广阔温热的雪白肌肤形成了尖锐的对比。

"You actually dared to come," she exhaled a puff of smoke, her voice lazy with natural arrogance.

"I thought corporate slaves only had the courage to peek at magazines."

“你竟然真敢来。”她吐出一口烟雾，声音慵懒，带着天生的傲慢。

“我以为社畜只有偷看杂志的胆量。”

Chen Mo stood at the door, the blood rushing to his head. The humiliation of being toyed with and the irrepressible desire immediately entangled.

陈默站在门口，血往脑门上涌。被愚弄的屈辱感和无法压抑的欲望瞬间纠缠在一起。

"Who are you really? Mrs. Lin, or Kurosaki Miyetsuko?" He questioned coldly, trying to maintain his dignity.

“你到底是谁？林女士，还是黑崎美悦子？”他冷硬地质问，试图维持自己的尊严。

She chuckled softly, stubbed out the cigarette, stood up slowly, and walked toward him.

她轻笑了一声，掐灭了烟头，缓缓站起身，朝他走来。

As she approached, that familiar scent—the mix of milk and expensive spice—hit him again, aggressively invading Chen Mo's defensive line. The visual impact of her figure hanging heavily in the tight dress was far more shocking than when she was in the loose yukata.

随着她的靠近，那股熟悉的味道——乳香混合着昂贵香料的气息——再次扑面而来，霸道地侵入陈默的防线。她那在紧身裙包裹下沉甸甸坠着的这一身皮肉，视觉冲击力远比宽松浴衣时来得震撼。

She stopped half a meter in front of him.

她在距离他半米的地方停下。

"Does it matter?" She raised her hand, her cool fingertips sporting sharp crimson nails, and gently slid across Chen Mo's tense jawline.

"In Izu, you didn't seem to care about my name when you buried your face in my chest."

“这重要吗？”她抬起手，冰凉的指尖带着锋利的绯红指甲，轻轻滑过陈默紧绷的下颌线。

“在伊豆，当你把脸埋在我胸口的时候，你似乎并不在乎我叫什么名字。”
