The Wise Turtle and the Fast Rabbit

Once, a fast rabbit laughed at a slow turtle. "You are too slow to ever win a race," said the rabbit.

The turtle smiled calmly. "Let's race tomorrow."

The next day, all animals gathered to watch. The rabbit ran quickly and was soon far ahead. He took a nap under a tree, thinking he had plenty of time.

The turtle kept moving slowly but steadily. He never stopped, believing that slow progress is still progress.

When the rabbit woke up, he was shocked to see the turtle already at the finish line.

Moral: Slow and steady wins the race. Consistency beats speed in the end.
