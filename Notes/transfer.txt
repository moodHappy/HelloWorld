The Wig

假发

1. The Shop on the Corner

街角的店

The shop was narrow and quiet, pressed between a bakery and a phone repair stand.

这家店很窄，也很安静，被挤在面包店和手机维修摊之间。

A faded plastic head watched the street from the window, wearing brown hair that shone too much in the sun.

橱窗里一只褪色的塑料头望着街道，戴着一顶在阳光下亮得过分的棕色头发。

Lin stopped there three times before she finally walked in.

林在门口停了三次，才真正走进去。

Inside, the air smelled of powder, glue, and something slightly sweet.

屋里有粉末、胶水，还有一点点发甜的味道。

The owner looked up only once, then went back to sewing thin threads into a dark net.

店主只抬头看了一眼，又低头把细线缝进一张深色的网里。

“You want something natural,” he said, as if reading a note she had not written.

“你想要看起来像真的。”他说，像是在读一张她没写出的纸条。

Lin touched her own short hair without answering.

林没有回答，只是摸了摸自己很短的头发。

2. The Reason She Didn’t Say

她没有说出的原因

She had cut it two weeks ago in a bathroom with weak yellow light.

两周前，她在一间灯光发黄的浴室里把头发剪掉了。

The scissors were old and pulled at the strands instead of slicing them clean.

剪刀很旧，拉扯着发丝，而不是干脆地切断。

Hair fell into the sink, the floor, and the sleeve of her shirt.

头发落在水池里、地上，还有她的袖口里。

She did not cry then.

那时她没有哭。

People always expected tears at the wrong moment.

人们总是在错误的时刻期待眼泪。

The crying came later, in a supermarket, when she reached back to tie a ponytail that no longer existed.

真正的哭是在后来，在超市里，她下意识把手伸到脑后，想扎一个已经不存在的马尾。

3. Trying It On

试戴

The owner placed the wig on her head with slow, careful hands.

店主用缓慢而小心的手把假发放到她头上。

The hair was softer than she expected.

头发比她想的要柔软。

It brushed her neck in a way that felt almost familiar.

它擦过她的脖子，带来一种几乎熟悉的感觉。

She looked into the mirror but focused on the space behind her reflection.

她看向镜子，却把目光放在倒影后面的空处。

“For work?” the owner asked.

“上班用？”店主问。

“For seeing people,” she said.

“见人用。”她说。

He nodded, as if that explained everything.

他点了点头，好像这已经足够解释一切。

4. Walking Back Outside

走回街上

When she stepped out, the wind lifted the new hair slightly.

她走出门时，风把新的头发轻轻掀起一点。

No one stopped walking.

没有人停下脚步。

No one looked twice.

也没有人多看一眼。

She passed the bakery window and saw herself between rows of bright bread.

她经过面包店的橱窗，在一排排亮着光的面包之间看见自己。

For a moment, she tried to remember the weight of her real hair.

有一瞬间，她试着回想自己原来头发的重量。

The memory felt distant, like a room she had already moved out of.

那记忆很远，像一间她已经搬走的房间。

She kept walking, one hand lightly holding the side of the wig, not to hide it, only to feel that it was still there.

她继续往前走，一只手轻轻扶着假发的边缘，不是为了遮掩，只是想确认它还在。
