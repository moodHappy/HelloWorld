Morning After

清晨之后

Sunlight slipped through the thin curtains, painting the room in pale gold.

阳光从薄薄的窗帘缝隙洒进房间，给房间镀上淡淡的金色。

I woke first, feeling the weight of her head on my shoulder.

我先醒来，感觉到她的头压在我的肩膀上。

She stirred, eyes half-open, and whispered, “Morning.”

她动了动，半睁着眼睛低声说：“早上好。”

I smiled and brushed hair from her face, careful not to wake her fully.

我微笑着，把她脸上的发丝拨开，小心不让她完全醒来。

She shifted closer, wrapping an arm around me, pressing softly.

她靠得更近，手臂环住我，轻轻贴着。

“Breakfast?” I asked quietly.

“吃早饭吗？”我轻声问。

She nodded, then yawned, stretching her arms above her head.

她点点头，然后打了个哈欠，把手伸向头顶。

We dressed quickly, keeping a sense of normalcy between us.

我们迅速穿好衣服，保持着表面的平静。

The walk to the client’s office was short, the city just waking up.

去客户办公室的路很短，城市刚刚苏醒。

She carried her briefcase with her usual calm authority.

她提着公文包，依旧散发着一贯的沉稳气场。

I followed, still feeling the lingering warmth of the night.

我跟在后面，依旧感受到夜晚留下的余温。

At the office, she greeted the receptionist with a polite smile.

在办公室，她礼貌地对前台微笑打招呼。

The client waited in the conference room, papers neatly stacked.

客户在会议室等候，文件整齐地叠放着。

She motioned me to sit beside her, and I did, trying to focus.

她示意我坐在她旁边，我照做，努力集中注意力。

Her voice was confident as she outlined the proposal, pointing to charts and figures.

她的声音充满自信，讲解方案，同时指向图表和数据。

I added notes where necessary, occasionally glancing at her hands, remembering last night.

我在必要时做笔记，偶尔看她的手，想起昨晚。

The client nodded, asked questions, and she answered clearly, leaving no room for doubt.

客户点头，提问，她回答得清楚明了，没有留下任何疑问。

By the end, the deal was secured, and we walked out together, side by side.

会议结束，合同谈妥，我们并肩走出办公室。

She glanced at me briefly, a small smile playing on her lips.

她瞥了我一眼，嘴角浮现一抹笑意。

I felt the morning’s tension dissolve into the rhythm of the city around us.

我感到清晨的紧张随着周围城市的节奏逐渐消散。
