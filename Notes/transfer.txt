Title: Ashes in the Wind

I didn’t smell the smoke at first.
What woke me was the silence—an odd, heavy kind, the type that presses on your chest before danger arrives. In Wang Cheong House, even at midnight, someone’s TV was always too loud, someone’s baby always crying, someone’s wok hitting the stove. But that night, nothing.

Then the alarm still didn’t ring.

I opened the window to check the corridor, and that’s when the heat hit me—like someone pressed a furnace against my face. The scaffolding outside, wrapped in plastic netting for the renovation, had already turned into a giant torch. Flames crawled upward along the bamboo poles with a hunger I’d never imagined fire could have.

My first thought wasn’t escape.
It was my mother.

I ran to her room—she was coughing, confused, eyes red from smoke. I pulled her up, repeating “We need to go, we need to go,” although I wasn’t sure where. The stairwell hissed like a dragon’s throat. Smoke rose from below, black and thick, and the heat pushed us back as if the building itself was exhaling death.

We retreated into the flat, closing the metal gate. I soaked towels, covered my mother’s face, covered mine. The lights flickered, then died, plunging us into an orange glow cast by the inferno outside the windows. Every few seconds, something exploded—air conditioners, glass panes, bamboo joints snapping under heat.

People screamed through the walls.
People prayed.
People called names.
People beat on locked doors.

I dragged my mother to the kitchen, the furthest from the fire racing along the façade. We crouched on the floor tiles, hands interlocked, waiting for either rescue or collapse—whichever reached us first. I told her we would be fine, though the smoke stole half the words from my throat.

Forty-three hours.
They said later that’s how long the fire burned.

But inside that night, time dissolved.
Every minute felt like a lifetime measured by heartbeats and ash.

Firefighters finally broke into our unit at dawn. I remember their silhouettes—dark figures cutting through the grey smoke, calling out hoarsely, “We’ve got survivors here!” They carried my mother first. Her fingers slipped from mine, limp but warm.

Outside, the world had changed.
Seven buildings stood scorched.
Our home—our years—reduced to wet rubble and black skeletons of bamboo poles.
Names were shouted.
Names were missing.
Names would never answer again.

They wrapped us in blankets, but I still felt the fire on my skin. Not the heat—
the memory.

Even now, weeks later, in the temporary shelter, sometimes I wake before dawn to that same terrible silence. For a moment, I’m back there again—kneeling on the kitchen floor, holding my mother’s hand, waiting for the flames to decide our fate.

And each time, I whisper the same quiet promise:

“I survived.
So I will remember for those who couldn’t.”
