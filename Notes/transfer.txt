Chapter 32: The Call from Tokyo

第三十二章：来自东京的电话

Ring.

铃声。

It wasn't Miyetsuko's phone. It was the secure satellite phone Chen Mo kept in a lockbox. Only three people knew the number.

不是美悦子的手机。是陈默锁在保险箱里的安全卫星电话。只有三个人知道这个号码。

Chen Mo picked it up. "Speak."

陈默接起电话。“说。”

"Chen Mo. My favorite employee." Mishima's voice came through, clear as crystal. The latency was zero. He was using military bandwidth.

“陈默。我最喜欢的员工。”三岛的声音传来，清晰如水晶。零延迟。他在使用军用频段。

"Congratulations on the acquisition," Chen Mo said coldly, putting the phone on speaker so Miyetsuko could hear.

“恭喜收购，”陈默冷冷地说，打开了扬声器让美悦子也能听到。

"Thank you. Your data was... instrumental," Mishima chuckled. "But now, let's talk business. I own Kurosaki's debts now. And that includes his wife."

“谢谢。你的数据……起到了关键作用，”三岛轻笑。“但现在，我们来谈谈生意。我现在拥有了黑崎的债务。这其中包括他的妻子。”

Miyetsuko grabbed the phone.

美悦子抢过电话。

"I am not a debt, Mishima. I am the one who bankrupts you."

“我不是债务，三岛。我是那个让你破产的人。”

"Ah, the Queen speaks. Still so feisty. I like it," Mishima's voice dropped a tone, becoming intimate, creepy. "I saw the video from the yacht. The one with the Police Chief. Fantasma sells everything, you know? Even his 'partners'."

“啊，女王说话了。还是这么充满活力。我喜欢，”三岛的声音低了一个调，变得亲密、令人毛骨悚然。“我看到了游艇上的视频。和警察局长的那段。幽灵什么都卖，你知道吗？甚至出卖他的‘合伙人’。”

Miyetsuko froze. Her hand gripped the phone so hard her knuckles turned white.

美悦子僵住了。她握电话的手太用力，指关节都白了。

"You look beautiful when you are ruthless, Miyetsuko. But you made a mistake. You humiliated 'The Butcher' at the casino. And The Butcher... he is a friend of mine."

“你无情的时候真美，美悦子。但你犯了个错误。你在赌场羞辱了‘屠夫’。而屠夫……他是我的朋友。”

"What do you want?"

“你想要什么？”

"I want you back in Tokyo. In my bed. By Friday. Or I fund The Butcher to turn Rio into your grave."

“我要你回东京。到我的床上。周五之前。否则我就资助屠夫，把里约变成你的坟墓。”

Click.

咔哒。

The line went dead.

电话挂断。
