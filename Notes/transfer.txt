Chapter 1: The Carnival of Blood

第一集：血色狂欢

The helicopter landed on a private dock, the hum of its rotors fading into the sultry Rio night. Neon lights from the carnival reflected off the water, fractured into dancing streaks across Miyetsuko’s silk robe. She stepped down, bare feet meeting warm wood, and Chen Mo followed silently, his black suit absorbing the colors around him.

直升机降落在私人码头，旋翼的嗡鸣渐渐消失在里约夜晚的闷热中。狂欢节的霓虹灯映在水面上，折射出斑斓光影，在美悦子的丝绸睡袍上跳动。她迈下直升机，赤足触碰温热的木板，陈默默默跟在身后，黑色西装吸收着周围的光色。

Fantasma awaited them on the yacht, leaning against the polished rail, a cigarette burning between his fingers. He exhaled slowly, smoke curling into the humid air. “You’re beautiful,” he said with a smirk. “But let’s see if beauty can survive Rio’s tests.”

幽灵在游艇上等候，倚在抛光栏杆上，手指间夹着燃烧的香烟，烟雾在闷热空气中盘旋。“你很美，”他带着笑意说道，“不过让我们看看美貌能否在里约的考验中存活。”

Miyetsuko tilted her head, crimson lips curling. “Tests?” Her voice was silk and steel. “I create the tests, Fantasma. You merely participate.” She moved with feline grace, the robe sliding off her shoulder just enough to reveal pale skin against the shadows.

美悦子歪着头，鲜红的嘴唇轻轻上扬。“考验？”她的声音如丝又如钢。“考验由我创造，幽灵，你只是参与而已。”她动作如猫般优雅，睡袍从肩头滑落，恰好露出与阴影形成对比的苍白肌肤。

The task was clear: seduce the port chief to gain access to the docks. Fantasma’s eyes glinted with amusement, as though he were placing a wild animal in a gilded cage. Miyetsuko accepted the unspoken challenge, stepping onto the yacht with deliberate slowness, letting each heartbeat announce her presence.

任务明确：色诱港口局长以获取码头通行权限。幽灵的眼中闪着趣味，好似将野兽置入镀金牢笼。美悦子接受了这无言的挑战，缓缓踏上游艇，让每一次心跳宣告她的存在。

Chen Mo remained in the shadows of the deck, earpiece in, eyes scanning every angle. His hand hovered near his concealed weapon, ready. “Remember,” he whispered into the comm. “Every word, every gesture. Control the situation, or control ends.”

陈默隐在甲板暗影中，耳机中监听着，眼睛扫视每个角落。手悬在隐藏武器上，随时准备行动。“记住，”他低语到通讯器中，“每一句话，每一个动作。掌控局势，否则掌控就终结。”

Inside the chief’s cabin, the man leaned back, arrogance painted across his face. He smiled, condescending. Miyetsuko let him approach, let his hands wander slightly, then froze, eyes narrowing. Every nerve in her body was alert, yet every move calculated. When he reached for her throat in mock dominance, she twisted, a glint of metal catching the faint neon. The hairpin plunged into his eye, blood spraying across polished wood and silk.

局长的舱室内，男人靠在椅背上，傲慢写在脸上。他笑着，带着轻蔑。美悦子让他靠近，让手略微游走，然后停住，眼神锐利。她全身神经高度紧绷，但每一步都经过计算。当他以假装支配的手触碰她的喉间，她旋身，金属在微弱霓虹下闪光——发簪刺入他的眼睛，鲜血飞溅在抛光木板与丝绸上。

She stood, blood dripping, robe clinging to her curves, and tossed the tablet—its screen smeared with his blood—into Fantasma’s champagne. The message was unmistakable: she was not prey, she was predator.

她站立，鲜血顺着身体滴落，睡袍紧贴曲线，将平板扔进幽灵的香槟杯中，屏幕上沾满他的血。信息清晰无误：她不是猎物，而是猎手。

Fantasma laughed, dark and low, a growl of approval and fear entwined. Chen Mo emerged from the shadows, eyes on Miyetsuko, calculating, protective. She turned to him, crimson lips curved, gaze hungry, and whispered, “Rio isn’t ready for me. Not yet.”

幽灵低沉地笑了，笑声中带着赞许与恐惧的交织。陈默从暗影中走出，目光锁在美悦子身上，计算、保护兼具。她转向他，鲜红的嘴唇弯起，眼神炽烈，低语：“里约还没准备好面对我。还不够。”

The carnival pulsed outside, oblivious. Music, neon, and sweat mingled in the humid night—but within the yacht, control, blood, and desire had claimed the throne. The Queen had arrived.

狂欢节的节奏在外面跳动，音乐、霓虹与汗水混合在闷热夜里——而在游艇上，掌控、鲜血与欲望早已登上王座。女王降临。
