The Midnight Library

Elara worked in the peculiar library where books rewrote themselves each midnight. Every morning, she'd discover new tales within familiar covers. One evening, she decided to stay after closing. As the clock struck twelve, books began trembling. Pages fluttered wildly as ink rearranged itself into fresh stories. To her astonishment, Elara watched her own life story materialize in a blank journal. She saw moments she had forgotten and futures yet to come. When dawn broke, she understood: the library wasn't just rewriting booksâ€”it was rewriting destinies. And now, she held the pen.
