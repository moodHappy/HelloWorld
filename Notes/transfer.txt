Maya lived in a world where emotions left colored footprints. Yellow for joy, blue for sadness, red for anger. One morning, she noticed her gray path had transformed into vibrant rainbow swirls overnight. Curious, she followed her trail from the previous day. She had unknowingly spread happiness throughout townâ€”golden footsteps made the baker smile, purple wonder made an old widow's garden bloom. Maya realized her emotions didn't just color her own path; they painted the world around her. From that day forward, she danced wherever she went, leaving trails of brilliant colors for others to discover.
