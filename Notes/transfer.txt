In the classroom, Ms. Thompson welcomed everyone with a warm smile. New faces, old friends, and the promise of a fresh start filled the air. As Lily wrote her name on the first page of her notebook, she felt a spark of curiosity. The first day of school had begun, bringing new challenges, new knowledge, and new adventures waiting to unfold.
