Chen Mo held The Butcher's severed thumb against the phone screen. The banking app flashed green.

陈默拿着屠夫那根断掉的拇指按在手机屏幕上。银行APP闪过绿光。

"Balance: $45 Million USD."

“余额：4500万美元。”

"Transfer it," Miyetsuko said, leaning against the ruined altar, cleaning her ceramic knife with a piece of the red dress she had torn off. "All of it. To the lieutenants."

“转账，”美悦子靠在废墟祭坛上，用撕下的一块红裙布料擦拭她的陶瓷刀。“全部。转给他的副手们。”

"The Butcher's men are mercenaries," Chen Mo tapped the screen rapidly. "They don't mourn the dead; they mourn the paycheck."

“屠夫的人都是雇佣兵，”陈默飞快地敲击屏幕。“他们不哀悼死人；他们只哀悼工资单。”

Ping.

叮。

A message was sent to the phones of the surviving armored truck drivers outside:

"New Management. Double Pay. Target: Fantasma. Kill him, and you get a bonus."

一条信息发到了外面幸存装甲卡车司机的手机上：

“新管理层。双倍薪水。目标：幽灵。杀了他，还有奖金。”

Outside, the shooting stopped. Engines revved. The guns that were pointed at the ruins turned around, aiming back towards the city.

外面，枪声停了。引擎轰鸣。原本指向废墟的枪口调转了方向，指向了城市。

"They took the bait," Chen Mo stood up. He threw the severed thumb into the jungle.

“他们咬钩了，”陈默站起来。把那根断指扔进了丛林。

Miyetsuko walked over to him. She ran her hand down his chest, over the Kevlar vest, stopping at his belt.

美悦子走向他。她的手顺着他的胸口滑下，越过凯夫拉背心，停在他的皮带上。

"You just bought an army with a dead man's finger," she smiled, her eyes glittering dangerously. "That's sexy."

“你刚用一根死人的手指买下了一支军队，”她笑了，眼里闪烁着危险的光芒。“真性感。”

"I did it for you," Chen Mo grabbed her waist, pulling her flush against him. The friction of their tactical gear was rough, abrasive, and electrifying. "Now, let's go get your throne back."

“我是为你做的，”陈默搂住她的腰，把她紧紧拉向自己。战术装备的摩擦感粗糙、生硬，却让人触电。“现在，去把你的王座拿回来。”
