Chapter 9: The Apology of the Ghost

第九章：幽灵的歉意

Ten minutes later. The pit was closed. The floor was washed. The DJ started the music again. The party resumed as if nothing had happened.

十分钟后。坑被关上了。地板被冲洗干净。DJ重新开始了音乐。派对继续，仿佛什么都没发生过。

"My apologies, Mrs. Tanaka," Fantasma walked over, wiping a speck of blood from his white shoe. "A little... pest control problem. I hope it didn't ruin your evening."

“非常抱歉，田中太太，”幽灵走过来，擦掉白鞋上的一点血迹。“一点小小的……害虫控制问题。希望没有毁了您的夜晚。”

"On the contrary," Miyetsuko turned to him. Her face was flushed, her eyes glistening with a dangerous, wet sheen. She looked like she was running a high fever. "It was... stimulating."

“恰恰相反，”美悦子转向他。她脸颊潮红，眼睛里闪烁着危险的、湿润的光泽。她看起来像是发了高烧。“这非常……刺激。”

Fantasma looked at her, then at Chen Mo. He saw the way Miyetsuko was leaning against Chen Mo, her body practically vibrating. He laughed, understanding immediately.

幽灵看了看她，又看了看陈默。他看到了美悦子靠在陈默身上的样子，她的身体几乎在震动。他大笑，立刻明白了。

"Ah. I see. The adrenaline," he winked. "You need to... release it."

“啊。我懂了。肾上腺素，”他眨了眨眼。“你们需要……释放一下。”

He snapped his fingers. A bodyguard handed him a gold key card.

他打了个响指。保镖递给他一张金色的房卡。

"Top floor. The 'Emperor Suite'. Soundproof. Bulletproof. And the bed... it floats on water. My personal favorite. Consider it a gift for the inconvenience."

“顶层。‘帝王套房’。隔音。防弹。而且那张床……是漂在水上的。我个人的最爱。当作是对刚才不便的赔礼。”

"Thank you," Miyetsuko took the card. Her fingers brushed Fantasma's hand, leaving a trail of heat.

“谢谢，”美悦子接过卡。手指擦过幽灵的手，留下一道热度。

She turned to Chen Mo, grabbing his tie and pulling him towards the elevator. She didn't say a word, but her eyes screamed: Now.

她转向陈默，抓住他的领带，拉着他走向电梯。她一句话没说，但她的眼神在尖叫：现在。
