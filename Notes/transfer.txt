Chapter 28: The Game of Codes

第二十八章：代码游戏

"What game?" The Russian asked, his voice like grinding stones.

“什么游戏？”俄罗斯人问，声音像磨石。

Miyetsuko took out her tablet.

美悦子拿出平板电脑。

"Currently, there are three shipments waiting at customs. One belongs to you, Colombian. Cocaine. Value: 20 million. One belongs to you, Russian. Assault rifles. Value: 15 million. And one..." she looked at Fantasma, "...is just bananas."

“目前，海关有三批货物在等待。一批是你的，哥伦比亚人。可卡因。价值：2000万。一批是你的，俄罗斯人。突击步枪。价值：1500万。还有一批……”她看着幽灵，“……是香蕉。”

"I can clear one shipment right now. The other two... get flagged for inspection by the Federal Police. Immediate seizure."

“我现在可以放行一批。另外两批……会被标记给联邦警察进行检查。立即扣押。”

She placed the tablet in the center of the table.

她把平板放在桌子中央。

"Bid for it. Not with money. But with territory."

“竞价吧。不用钱。用底盘。”

"You are bluffing," The Butcher sneered. He reached out his hairy hand to grab her wrist. "I take the tablet, I take the codes, and I take you."

“你在虚张声势，”屠夫冷笑。他伸出毛茸茸的手去抓她的手腕。“我抢走平板，抢走代码，再抢走你。”

Before his hand could touch her silk sleeve—

在他的手碰到她的丝绸袖子之前——

CRACK.

咔嚓。

Chen Mo moved.

陈默动了。

He didn't stand up. He didn't draw a gun. He simply grabbed The Butcher's finger—the index finger pointing at Miyetsuko—and snapped it backwards 90 degrees.

他没站起来。也没拔枪。他只是抓住了屠夫的手指——那根指着美悦子的食指——然后向后折了90度。

"AHHHHHH!" The Butcher screamed, falling to his knees.

“啊！！！！”屠夫惨叫，跪倒在地。

His bodyguards drew their guns.

Chen Mo's other hand was already holding a pistol under the table, aimed directly at The Butcher's crotch.

屠夫的保镖拔枪。

陈默的另一只手已经在桌下握着枪，直指屠夫的裤裆。

"Sit down," Chen Mo said softly. His voice was calm, like a librarian shushing a noisy patron.

“坐下，”陈默轻声说。他的声音很平静，像图书管理员在让吵闹的读者安静。

Miyetsuko didn't even look at the screaming man. She opened her lace fan and gently fanned herself, the breeze blowing a few strands of hair across Chen Mo's face.

美悦子甚至没看那个惨叫的男人。她打开蕾丝扇子，轻轻给自己扇风，微风吹动几缕发丝拂过陈默的脸。

"My pet is protective," she smiled at the Russian. "Now, Nikolai. Do you want your guns? Or do you want to lose a finger too?"

“我的宠物护主心切，”她对着俄罗斯人笑。“现在，尼古拉。你是想要你的枪？还是也想丢根手指？”
