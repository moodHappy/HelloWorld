Chapter 1: The Debt

第一章：债

Tokyo. The night before the rain.

东京。雨夜的前一天。

The smell of imminent ruin is distinct. It smells like old paper, fear, and cheap whiskey.

毁灭将至的气味是独特的。那是一种旧纸张、恐惧和廉价威士忌混合的味道。

Lin sat in his small, dimly lit study. The room was a mess of ledger books and overdue notices. Once a proud importer of fine silks, Lin was now just another insect caught in the spiderweb of the Kurosaki Group.

林坐在昏暗狭小的书房里。房间里乱七八糟地堆满了账本和逾期通知单。曾经引以为傲的高级丝绸进口商，如今不过是挂在黑崎集团蜘蛛网上的又一只昆虫。

"Five hundred million yen," he whispered, the number rolling off his tongue like a curse. "By tomorrow."

“五亿日元，”他低声念叨，这个数字像咒语一样从舌尖滚落。“明天就要。”

The door creaked. Miyetsuko peeked in. At nineteen, she was already blossoming into something dangerous, though she didn't know it yet. She wore a loose university sweatshirt that hid the monstrous curves which would later define her fate. Her face was innocent, unmarred by the cruelty of men.

门吱呀一声开了。美悦子探进头来。十九岁的她已经开始绽放出一种危险的特质，尽管她自己浑然不觉。她穿着一件宽松的大学卫衣，遮住了那日后将决定她命运的惊人曲线。她的脸庞纯真，尚未被男人的残忍所玷污。

"Father? Are you coming to eat?" her voice was soft, concerned. "You haven't slept in days."

“父亲？你不来吃饭吗？”她的声音温柔而关切。“你已经好几天没睡了。”

Lin looked at his daughter. He saw her mother in her, but amplified. The heavy chest that strained against the cotton fabric, the wide, dark eyes. He felt a pang of sickening guilt. He knew what Soichiro Kurosaki liked. He knew what the loan sharks whispered about when they saw her photo on his desk.

林看着女儿。他在她身上看到了她母亲的影子，但更加极致。那在棉布下紧绷的沉重胸部，那双深邃的大眼睛。一阵令人作呕的愧疚感袭来。他知道黑崎宗一郎喜欢什么。他知道那些高利贷者在他桌上看到她的照片时，私下里在窃窃私语些什么。

"I... I'm not hungry, Miyetsuko," Lin choked out, turning his chair away. "Go to bed. Lock your door."

“我……我不饿，美悦子，”林哽咽着说，转过椅子背对着她。“去睡觉吧。锁好门。”

"But—"

“可是——”

"GO!" he snapped, his voice cracking.

“去睡！”他吼道，声音破碎。

Startled, Miyetsuko bowed hurriedly and retreated. The silence returned, heavier than before.

美悦子被吓了一跳，慌忙鞠了一躬退了出去。寂静重归，比之前更加沉重。

Lin opened the drawer. Inside lay a snub-nosed revolver and a contract. The contract had a clause in fine print: In the event of the debtor's death, all assets and liabilities shall be transferred to the direct kin.

林拉开抽屉。里面放着一把短鼻左轮手枪和一份合同。合同里有一行小字条款：若债务人死亡，所有资产及债务将转由直系亲属承担。

He picked up the pen, his hand shaking violently. He thought suicide was the escape. He thought if he was gone, the shame would end. He was a coward. He didn't read the fine print closely enough. He didn't realize that in Kurosaki's world, a daughter was an asset. A very liquid asset.

他拿起笔，手剧烈地颤抖着。他以为自杀就是解脱。他以为只要他死了，耻辱就会终结。他是个懦夫。他没有仔细读那些小字。他没有意识到，在黑崎的世界里，女儿也是一种资产。一种流动性极强的资产。

He wrote a short note: I am sorry.

他写了一张简短的字条：对不起。

He put the gun in his mouth. The metal tasted of oil and finality.

他把枪放进嘴里。金属带着枪油和终结的味道。

BANG.

砰。

The sound was not loud, muffled by the flesh of his skull. He slumped forward onto the desk, blood soaking into the ledger, turning the red ink into a dark crimson pool.

声音并不大，被他的头骨包裹变得沉闷。他向前瘫倒在桌子上，鲜血浸透了账本，将红色的墨水染成了一滩暗红的血泊。

Two hours later.

两小时后。

Miyetsuko stood frozen in the doorway, her hands covering her mouth, a silent scream stuck in her throat. The smell of gunpowder and bowels filled the house.

美悦子僵在门口，双手捂着嘴，无声的尖叫卡在喉咙里。火药味和失禁的臭味弥漫在屋子里。

She hadn't even called the police yet when the front door opened without a key.

她还没来得及报警，前门就在没有钥匙的情况下被打开了。

Three men in black suits walked in. They didn't take off their shoes. The leader was a tall man with a scar running through his eyebrow—Kurosaki’s right-hand man, Tanaka.

三个穿着黑西装的男人走了进来。他们没有脱鞋。领头的是一个高大的男人，一道疤痕贯穿了他的眉毛——那是黑崎的副手，田中。

He walked past the trembling girl, ignoring her as if she were furniture, and stepped into the study. He looked at the dead body with mild annoyance.

他走过那个瑟瑟发抖的女孩身边，像对待一件家具一样无视了她，径直走进书房。他看着尸体，神情中带着一丝轻微的厌烦。

"Idiot," Tanaka muttered. He picked up the contract, carefully avoiding the bloodstains. "He thought dying would clear the tab."

“蠢货，”田中嘟囔道。他拿起那份合同，小心地避开血迹。“他以为死了就能清账。”

He turned around and walked out to the living room. Miyetsuko was backed against the wall, tears streaming down her pale face, her chest heaving rapidly in panic.

他转身走出书房来到客厅。美悦子背靠着墙壁，泪水顺着苍白的脸流下，胸口因极度恐慌而剧烈起伏。

Tanaka looked her up and down. His eyes lingered on the heaviness of her chest, calculating its market value.

田中上下打量着她。他的目光停留在她沉重的胸部，计算着它的市场价值。

"Lin Miyetsuko?" he asked, his voice devoid of emotion.

“林美悦子？”他问道，声音毫无感情。

"Who... who are you?" she stammered. "My father... he..."

“你们……你们是谁？”她结结巴巴地问。“我父亲……他……”

"Your father, Mr. Lin, defaulted on a loan of five hundred million yen. By the terms of his contract, the debt is now yours." Tanaka held up the blood-spattered paper.

“你父亲，林先生，拖欠了五亿日元的贷款。根据合同条款，现在这笔债是你的了。”田中举起那张溅了血的纸。

"I... I don't have money..." She shook her head, terror gripping her heart.

“我……我没有钱……”她摇着头，恐惧攫取了她的心脏。

"We know," Tanaka said coldly. He pulled out a phone and dialed a number. "Boss. He's dead... Yes. The girl is here... Yes, just as you described. Top tier."

“我们知道，”田中冷冷地说。他掏出手机拨通了一个号码。“老板。他死了……对。女孩在这……是的，正如你描述的那样。顶级货色。”

He hung up and signaled the other two men.

他挂断电话，向另外两个人示意。

"Grab her."

“带走。”

"No! NO!" Miyetsuko screamed as rough hands grabbed her arms. She struggled, but she was weak. One of the men grabbed a handful of her hair, yanking her head back.

“不！不！”美悦子尖叫着，粗暴的大手抓住了她的手臂。她挣扎着，但她太弱小了。其中一个男人抓起她的一把头发，猛地向后拉扯她的头。

"Don't damage the goods," Tanaka warned. "Kurosaki-sama wants to unwrap this one himself."

“别弄坏了货物，”田中警告道。“黑崎大人要亲自拆这个礼物。”

They dragged her out of the house, into the black sedan waiting in the night. The rain began to fall, washing away the innocence of her past life.

他们把她拖出房子，塞进了夜色中等待的黑色轿车。雨开始下了，冲刷着她过去生活中的天真。

As the car drove away, leaving her father's corpse cooling in the study, Miyetsuko didn't know that death would have been the easier option. She was heading to the Kurosaki estate.

当车子驶离，留下她父亲的尸体在书房里渐渐变冷时，美悦子并不知道，死亡其实是更轻松的选择。她正在去往黑崎庄园的路上。

Tomorrow, she would wear the Shiromuku. But tonight, she was just prey in a cage.

明天，她将穿上白无垢。但今晚，她只是笼中的猎物。
