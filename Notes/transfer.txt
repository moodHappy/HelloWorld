In luxury fashion, India helps European fashion houses make clothes.

India is good at making clothes. But companies do not speak much about the situation in Indian factories. Children often work there. Workers get only a little money. Big brands say ‘Made in France’ or ‘Made in Italy’ on clothes. But they really make them in India. This is not fair and transparent.

One special jacket costs 43,000 Euros. India does 2,000 hours of work on it. Europe does only 100 hours. But the label says ‘Made in France’ which is not really true.

Some brands are starting to say that they use India, but it is not easy in the fashion world.

Difficult words: luxury (of good quality and expensive), brand (a type of product), transparent (clear).
