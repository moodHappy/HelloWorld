Title: Perfect Memory

In the future, everyone had an implant called Recall—a chip that recorded every moment of their lives. No more lies, no more doubts. Every argument could be replayed, every memory revisited.

Evelyn loved it—until she caught her husband smiling at another woman in the supermarket. One replay led to another, each pause and glance magnified.

She spent nights scrolling through fragments of his expressions, rewinding, zooming, analyzing.

When she finally confronted him, he looked at her with tired eyes and said, “You don’t love me—you love the recordings of me.”

Later that night, Evelyn deleted him from her Recall. But the silence in her head felt worse than betrayal.
