Chapter 31: Blue Velvet and White Flame

第三十一章：蓝丝绒与白火焰

The cheap neon blue light of the "Underwater World" room painted Miyetsuko's skin with a strange, oceanic glow.
“水下世界”房间廉价的霓虹蓝光，给美悦子的皮肤镀上了一层奇异的海洋光泽。

She stood there, shivering.
The torn white shirt hung from her elbows, revealing that breathtaking landscape of flesh.
The cold rain had tightened her skin, yet the heat radiating from her body burned like a furnace.

她站在那里，瑟瑟发抖。
撕破的白衬衫挂在手肘上，暴露出令人窒息的肉体景观。
冷雨让皮肤紧致，但体内散发出的热量却像火炉般炽烈。

"Don't just look…"
She commanded, weak yet imperious.
"Touch me. Prove I'm still alive."

“别光看着……”
她命令道，虚弱却带着威严。
“碰我。证明我还活着。”

Chen Mo stepped forward without speaking.
He wrapped an arm around her waist—softness sinking into his palms.
He pulled her wet, heavy body hard against his chest.

陈默走近，没有说话。
他搂住她的腰，柔软在掌心下沉。
将她湿漉沉重的身体用力压向自己。

The collision of skin felt electric.

皮肤相撞，像电流窜过。

"You are crazy," he murmured, burying his face in her neck, inhaling rain, sweat, and that maddening feminine scent.

“你是个疯子。”
他低声说，把脸埋进她的颈窝，贪婪呼吸雨水、汗水与那令人发狂的气息。

"I'm your crazy woman now…"
Her fingers tangled in his hair, pulling him down.

“我现在是你的疯女人……”
她的手指缠进他的头发，把他按向自己。

They fell onto the round bed.
Cheap satin—cold and slippery.
Bodies—burning.

他们跌进圆床。
廉价缎面冰冷滑腻。
而身体滚烫。

This wasn’t tenderness.
It was survival colliding with survival—
primitive, desperate, violent.

这不是温柔。
这是幸存者与幸存者的碰撞——
原始、绝望、暴烈。
