Chapter 6: The Jaguar's Den

第六章：美洲豹的巢穴

"Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka! Welcome to my humble home!"

“田中先生，田中太太！欢迎来到寒舍！”

A booming voice cut through the music. The crowd parted.

一个洪亮的声音切断了音乐。人群分开。

El Fantasma walked down the stairs. He was a giant of a man, shirtless, covered in tattoos of skeletons. He wore white suit pants and held a leash.

“幽灵”走下楼梯。他是个巨人，赤裸上身，满身骷髅纹身。他穿着白色西装裤，手里牵着一条皮带。

At the end of the leash was a black jaguar. A real, living nightmare with yellow eyes.

皮带的另一头是一只黑豹。一个活生生的、长着黄色眼睛的噩梦。

"Fantasma," Chen Mo stepped forward, putting Miyetsuko slightly behind him. "We brought the 'art catalog'."

“幽灵，”陈默上前一步，把美悦子稍微挡在身后。“我们带了‘艺术品目录’。”

"Business later. Pleasure now," Fantasma's eyes locked onto Miyetsuko. He didn't look at her face; he looked at the gold chains struggling to contain her breasts.

“生意待会儿谈。先享乐，”幽灵的眼睛锁定了美悦子。他没看她的脸；他在看那些在她的双乳上挣扎的金链。

"Your wife... she is a masterpiece," Fantasma licked his lips. "Japanese women are usually so... quiet. But she? She looks like she could eat my jaguar."

“你老婆……她是个杰作，”幽灵舔了舔嘴唇。“日本女人通常很……安静。但她？她看起来像是能吃掉我的美洲豹。”

Miyetsuko stepped out from behind Chen Mo. She walked straight up to the drug lord and his beast.

美悦子从陈默身后走出来。她径直走向那个毒枭和他的野兽。

The jaguar growled, baring its fangs.

黑豹低吼，露出獠牙。

Miyetsuko didn't flinch. She knelt down—the gold chains clinking—and extended her hand. Not to the man, but to the jaguar.

美悦子没有退缩。她跪下来——金链发出清脆的响声——伸出了手。不是伸向人，而是伸向黑豹。

"Quiet, kitty," she whispered. She scratched the jaguar behind the ear. The beast stopped growling and leaned into her hand, purring.

“安静，小猫，”她低声说。她挠了挠黑豹的耳后。那头野兽停止了低吼，把头靠在她手里，发出呼噜声。

Fantasma laughed, clapping his hands. "She tamed 'Midnight'! I like her! Come, VIP section. Let's drink."

幽灵大笑，拍着手。“她驯服了‘午夜’！我喜欢她！来，去VIP区。喝酒。”
