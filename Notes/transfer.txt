The Scissors

那把剪刀

She remembered buying the scissors with her mother many years ago.

她记得那把剪刀是多年前和母亲一起买的。

They stood in a small household shop near the bus stop.

她们站在公交站旁的一家小五金店里。

The shelves were crowded with plastic basins, light bulbs, and cheap mirrors.

货架上挤满了塑料盆、灯泡，还有廉价的镜子。

Her mother picked up the scissors, opened and closed them once, and listened to the sound.

母亲拿起剪刀，开合了一下，听了听声音。

“This one is sharp enough,” she said.

“这把够锋利了。”她说。

Lin nodded and paid without thinking much about it.

林点了点头，付了钱，当时并没有多想。

They used the scissors later to cut tags off clothes, trim loose threads, and open stubborn packages.

后来这把剪刀用来剪衣服标签、修线头、拆难开的包装。

It stayed under the sink for years.

它在水池下面放了很多年。

When Lin held it again, her mother had already been gone for a long time.

当林再次拿起它时，母亲已经离开很久了。

The handle was worn smooth where her mother’s thumb had rested.

手柄上母亲拇指常放的位置已经磨得很光滑。

Lin closed her fingers around it.

林把手指收紧。

She did not think of calling anyone.

她没有想到要给任何人打电话。

She turned toward the mirror.

她转身面对镜子。
