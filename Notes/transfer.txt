"Mom, why does Mr. Chen use that wheelchair?" asked Lily.

"He had an accident years ago, sweetie," her mother replied gently.

"Can he still play basketball like Dad?"

"Actually, he's amazing at wheelchair basketball! He was on the national team."

"Oh! Can we meet him?"

"Sure. Remember, disability doesn't define people. Mr. Chen is an engineer, a father, and a great basketball player."

When they met, Mr. Chen smiled. "Nice to meet you, Lily. Want to see my basketball medal?"

Lily's eyes widened. "You're amazing!"

He laughed. "We all have different abilities, don't we?"
