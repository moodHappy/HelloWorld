Chapter 19: The Ghost in the Rain

第十九章：雨中的幽灵

Ten minutes later. The back alley of the Logistics Center.

十分钟后。物流中心的后巷。

A garbage chute opened, and a figure covered in filth and grease slid out, crashing heavily into a pile of wet cardboard boxes.

一个垃圾滑道打开，一个满身污秽和油污的人影滑了出来，重重地摔在湿漉漉的纸箱堆里。

Chen Mo lay in the mud, letting the heavy rain wash over his face. He gasped for air, his lungs burning like fire, while his skin was freezing cold.

陈默躺在泥水里，任由暴雨冲刷着他的脸。他大口喘息，肺部像火烧一样疼，皮肤却冷得刺骨。

He was alive.

他活着。

He spat out the USB drive from his mouth. It was covered in his blood—he had bitten his tongue when he fell.

他吐出了嘴里的U盘。上面沾满了他自己的血——刚才摔下来时咬破了舌头。

He took out the waterproof phone he had prepared. The screen was cracked, but it still worked.

他掏出那部早就准备好的防水手机。屏幕裂了，但还能用。

There was one missed call. From an unknown number.

有一个未接来电。来自未知号码。

Chen Mo stared at the number, his eyes cold and terrifying, like a wolf that had just crawled out of hell. He dialed back.

陈默盯着那个号码，眼神冷厉得可怕，像一头刚从地狱爬出来的狼。他拨了回去。

"Beep... Beep..."

“嘟……嘟……”

"Hello?" Miyetsuko's voice came through. She sounded surprised. "You... you're still alive?"

“喂？”美悦子的声音传来。带着一丝惊讶。“你……你还活着？”

"Disappointed?" Chen Mo's voice was hoarse, sounding like scraping sandpaper.

“很失望吗？”陈默的声音沙哑，像砂纸摩擦一样。

"I'm surprised." She paused. "But it doesn't matter. You escaped, but you have nothing. The server has been wiped. I saw the logs remotely. Kurosaki destroyed everything to cover up the scandal. I won. He lost his leverage."

“我很意外。”她停顿了一下。“但这不重要了。你逃出来了，但你一无所有。服务器已经被清洗了。我远程看到了日志。黑崎为了掩盖丑闻，销毁了一切。我赢了。他失去了他的把柄。”

"You won?" Chen Mo laughed, a low, menacing laugh in the rain.

“你赢了？”陈默在雨中发出一声低沉阴森的笑。

"What are you laughing at?" Miyetsuko's tone suddenly became uneasy.

“你笑什么？”美悦子的语气突然变得不安。

"You think you used me to burn the house down. But you forgot, I'm the one who carried the firewood."

“你以为你利用我烧掉了房子。但你忘了，我是那个搬柴火的人。”

Chen Mo held the USB drive tightly in his hand, the sharp corner piercing his palm.

陈默紧紧捏着手里的U盘，棱角刺破了手掌。

"I have a backup, Miyetsuko. The real list. The one you wanted to destroy, and the one he wanted to hide. It's all in my hand."

“我有备份，美悦子。真正的名单。那份你想销毁的，和他想隐藏的。全都在我手里。”

Silence. Deathly silence on the other end of the phone.

沉默。电话那头死一般的沉默。

"Now," Chen Mo stood up, staggering towards the lights of the distant city. "The game has changed. I am no longer the pawn."

“现在，”陈默站起来，跌跌撞撞地走向远处城市的灯火。“游戏规则变了。我不再是棋子了。”

"Come and find me. Or... I will send this list to everyone. Your husband's enemies, the police, the CIA... and your husband."

“来找我。或者……我把这份名单发给所有人。你丈夫的仇家、警察、CIA……还有你的丈夫。”

"Chen Mo, don't be stupid..." Her voice finally showed a trace of panic.

“陈默，别做傻事……”她的声音终于带上了一丝慌乱。

"Bring cash. Bring a car. And bring your sincere body." Chen Mo hung up the phone.

“带上现金。带上车。带上你诚实的身体。”陈默挂断了电话。

He threw the phone into the sewer.

他把手机扔进了下水道。

The rain stopped.

雨停了。

The hunter has become the hunted. And the prey has just grown fangs.

猎人变成了猎物。而猎物，刚刚长出了獠牙。
