# The Cult Novel

Elara discovered the manuscript in her late aunt's attic—a handwritten novel titled "The Devouring Void." As she read, its dark prose seeped into her dreams, blurring reality with fiction. Strange symbols appeared on her walls, identical to those in the book.

One night, a knock at her door revealed three figures in black robes, their faces identical to characters from the novel. "We've been waiting for you," they whispered. "The author must complete the story."

Elara realized too late that she wasn't reading a novel—she was reading a prophecy. And the protagonist was about to meet her tragic end.
