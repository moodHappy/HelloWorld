The antique mirror in Elara's hallway didn't just show her reflectionâ€”it showed possibilities. When she stood before it, she could see versions of herself: one as a renowned painter, fingers stained with vibrant colors; another as an astronaut, floating among stars; and a third, simpler version, tending to a garden with gentle hands. Each morning, the mirror presented a different path, but Elara never knew which reality she might step into. She began to wonder: were these glimpses of what could be, or parallel lives already being lived? One day, she reached out to touch the glass, and for the first time, her reflection reached back.
