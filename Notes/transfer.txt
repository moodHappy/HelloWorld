Many shops in the UK sell bad cigarettes. These cigarettes are not legal. Police want to stop it, but it is difficult. Some people who work in the shops are not allowed to work in the UK.

The cigarettes are under the floor in the shop. They are in bags and boxes. Some people laugh about it. Some shops open again after the police leave.

Reporters go to many shops. They find illegal cigarettes in many places. Some shops sell other bad things too. This makes a big problem. Police and other workers try to help, but it is not easy. Police say this activity is as bad as selling hard drugs.
