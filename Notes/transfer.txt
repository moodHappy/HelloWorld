Chapter 18: The Cocktail of Power

第十八章：权力的鸡尾酒

Fantasma was sitting on a deck chair, smoking a cigar. His jaw dropped slightly as he saw her. The sight of a beautiful woman covered in gore triggered something primal in him—fear mixed with intense arousal.

幽灵坐在躺椅上，抽着雪茄。看到她时，他的下巴微微掉下来。一个浑身是血的美女触发了他原始的某种东西——恐惧混合着强烈的性兴奋。

"Mrs. Tanaka..." he started to stand up. "Is he...?"

“田中太太……”他刚要站起来。“他……？”

Miyetsuko didn't answer. She walked straight to him.

美悦子没回答。她径直走向他。

She stopped right in front of him. The smell of copper and musk hit Fantasma's nose.

她在他面前停下。铜锈味和麝香味冲进了幽灵的鼻子。

Splash.

哗啦。

She dropped the bloody tablet directly into Fantasma's crystal glass of whiskey. The amber liquid turned murky red instantly.

她把沾血的平板直接扔进了幽灵的水晶威士忌酒杯里。琥珀色的液体瞬间变成了浑浊的红色。

"Your problem is solved," she said, her voice husky, damaged from the screaming earlier. "The encryption is broken. The pig is dead."

“你的麻烦解决了，”她说，声音沙哑，那是刚才尖叫后的损伤。“加密破解了。那头猪死了。”

"Dead?" Fantasma looked at the tablet drowning in blood and alcohol. "You killed a Chief of Police on my boat?"

“死了？”幽灵看着淹没在血和酒里的平板。“你在我的船上杀了警察局长？”

"No," Miyetsuko leaned down.

“不，”美悦子俯下身。

The robe slipped off one shoulder. The curve of her breast, decorated with a smudge of drying blood right above the nipple, hovered inches from Fantasma's face. It was a terrifying, mesmerizing sight.

睡袍从一侧肩膀滑落。她乳房的弧线，就在乳头上方装饰着一抹干涸的血迹，悬在离幽灵脸几英寸的地方。那是一个可怕又迷人的景象。

" We killed him. You provided the venue. I provided the knife. We are partners in this murder now."

“是我们杀了他。你提供了场地。我提供了刀。我们现在是这场谋杀的共犯。”

She reached out, her finger tracing the rim of the bloody glass. Then she put that finger in her mouth and sucked the whiskey and blood off it. Her eyes locked onto Fantasma's.

她伸出手，手指划过那杯血酒的边缘。然后她把那根手指放进嘴里，吮吸掉上面的威士忌和血。她的眼睛死死锁住幽灵。

"And since I did the dirty work... I'm taking command."

“既然脏活是我干的……现在由我来指挥。”
