The lads at Westfield High were proper fed up when the school banned short skirts. So last Monday, they came up with a brilliant plan. In protest, about thirty of them showed up wearing Japanese-style school uniformsâ€”the girls' ones! Complete with pleated skirts and knee socks. The headmaster nearly fainted! "We're showing how ridiculous this rule is," said Tom, one of the boys. The protest went viral, with students from other schools joining in. By Friday, the school had reversed the ban. "Fair's fair," the principal admitted. The boys celebrated by changing back into their regular trousers. Well done, lads!
