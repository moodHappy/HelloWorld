# First Person Perspective, Tomb Raider

My flashlight cut through the darkness as I navigated the ancient tomb. Dust motes danced in the beam as I stepped carefully over the skeletal remains of previous visitors. The air grew thick with the scent of decay and time. Then I saw itâ€”the jade burial mask, glowing faintly in the dim light. My heart raced as I reached out, fingers trembling. That's when I heard the low hum, felt the floor tremble. The ancients' curse was real. Too late, I realized I'd triggered the trap. The ceiling began to crumble as I clutched the mask, wondering if my own bones would join those scattered below.
