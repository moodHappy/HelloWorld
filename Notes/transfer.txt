Chapter 10: Kurosaki’s Plaything

第十章：黑崎的玩物

Part 1: The Appointed Messenger

点名的使者

In the hierarchy of debt, Saori Mikage was the bridge. As the Lin family’s secretary and etiquette tutor, she was the only one Soichiro Kurosaki allowed into his private sanctum to discuss the "interest" on their loans. To the world, she was a professional; to Kurosaki, she was a living contract, a beautiful piece of collateral that he could summon at will.

在债务的层级中，御影沙织是那座桥梁。作为林家的秘书兼礼仪导师，她是黑崎宗一郎唯一允许进入私密圣殿讨论贷款“利息”的人。对外界而言，她是专业人士；对黑崎而言，她是一份活生生的契约，一件可以随叫随到的美丽抵押品。

Tonight, she stood in his study, the air thick with the smell of funeral incense and expensive scotch. Kurosaki sat behind his massive desk, his eyes bloodshot, staring at the empty chair where his son should have sat.

今晚，她站在他的书房里，空气中弥漫着浓烈的香火味和昂贵威士忌的味道。黑崎坐在巨大的写字台后，双眼布满血丝，盯着那个原本该由他儿子坐的空位。

"Come here, Saori," he rasped. His voice wasn't an invitation; it was a gravitational pull.

“过来，沙织，”他沙哑地说道。他的声音不是邀请，而是一种万有引力。

Part 2: The Vessel of Grief

悲恸的容器

Saori moved with her usual, heartbreaking submission. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. She knew that tonight, the debt wasn't about numbers; it was about the void in his chest. Kurosaki stood up, his movements heavy and violent. He grabbed her by the hair, pulling her head back to expose the pale column of her throat.

沙织带着她那惯常的、令人心碎的顺从走了过去。她没有说话，也不需要说话。她知道，今晚的债务与数字无关，而关乎他胸中的空洞。黑崎站起身，动作沉重而狂暴。他一把揪住她的头发，将她的头向后拽，露出了她苍白的颈项。

He didn't undress her with care. He tore at her silk blouse, the buttons scattering like pearls across the hardwood floor. He needed to feel something other than the cold ash of his son's death. He pushed her down onto the cold leather sofa, his hands bruising her skin as he forced himself between her thighs.

他并没有耐心地为她宽衣。他粗暴地撕开她的丝绸衬衫，纽扣像珍珠一样散落在硬木地板上。他需要感受到一些除了儿子死讯那般冰冷烟灰以外的东西。他将她按在冰冷的皮革沙发上，双手在她的肌肤上留下淤青，强行挤入她的双腿之间。

Part 3: Raw Redemption

露骨的救赎

The act was devoid of tenderness. It was a rhythmic, punishing assault. Saori’s back arched against the leather, her breath coming in sharp, broken sobs that were more biological reflex than emotional protest. Every time he thrust into her, Kurosaki felt the friction of her heat clashing with his own internal frost.

这场性爱毫无温柔可言。这是一种富有节奏的、惩罚性的冲撞。沙织的背部在皮革上弓起，呼吸变成了一声声短促、破碎的啜泣，这与其说是情感的抗议，不如说是生物性的反射。每当他深深刺入她的体内，黑崎都能感受到她的燥热与他内心的冰霜剧烈碰撞。

"Am I being punished, Saori?" he growled, his sweat dripping onto her vacant face. He drove into her with a desperate, primal force, seeking a bottom that didn't exist. Saori didn't answer with words; she only offered the入骨 (bone-deep) moans of a woman whose only function was to absorb the darkness of powerful men. Her body shook with involuntary tremors as she reached a climax born of pure, unadulterated friction and the terror of his grip.

“我是在受惩罚吗，沙织？”他低吼着，汗水滴落在她那空洞的脸上。他带着一种绝望、原始的力量撞击着她，试图寻找一个不存在的底限。沙织没有用语言回答，她只发出了那种入骨的呻吟，作为一个功能仅是吸收权势男人内心黑暗的女人。她的身体因不由自主的战栗而抖动，在高潮中沉沦，那快感纯粹源于不加修饰的摩擦和对他掌控的恐惧。

Part 4: The Divine Retribution

上天的惩罚

When it was over, Kurosaki slumped over her, his heart hammering against his ribs. The silence of the room returned, heavier than before. He looked at the portrait of his dead son and felt a sudden, chilling realization. The crash, the fire, the sudden end of his line—it wasn't an accident. It was a strike from above.

一切结束后，黑崎瘫倒在她身上，心脏剧烈地撞击着肋骨。房间恢复了沉默，且比之前更加沉重。他看着死去的儿子的画像，突然感到一种彻骨的领悟。车祸、大火、血脉的戛然而止——那不是意外，那是来自上天的重击。

"Heaven is watching," he whispered, his eyes widening. He felt the weight of every life he had ruined, every family he had dismantled.

“上天在看着呢，”他低声呢喃，双眼圆睁。他感受到了自己毁掉的每一条生命、拆散的每一个家庭的重量。

He pulled away from Saori, who lay there like a discarded doll, her skin slick with his exertion. He straightened his clothes, his hands finally trembling.

他离开了沙织，她像个被丢弃的布偶一样躺在那儿，皮肤上还沾着他发泄后的痕迹。他整理好衣服，双手终于开始颤抖。

"Tell the Lins," Kurosaki said, his voice hollow. "The hunt is paused. I will not add more blood to my ledger while my son is still cold. We wait. Until the mourning is over... we wait."

“告诉林家，”黑崎声音空洞，“围猎暂停。我儿子尸骨未寒，我不想再给我的账本增添血债了。等。等到丧期结束……我们等着。”
