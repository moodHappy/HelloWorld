As the teacher displayed the question, "Everyone came to school voluntarily, right? A. Yes B. A," the classroom filled with nervous laughter. Sarah raised her hand. "But both answers mean the same thing!"

The teacher smiled. "Exactly! It's like asking if you want homework - the answer's always yes, whether you like it or not."

The students groaned, recognizing the humor in their lack of real choice. They were here, ready for another semester, whether their hearts were in it or not. Sometimes, the illusion of choice is the funniest joke of all.
