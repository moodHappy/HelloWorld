Chapter 26: The Map on the Bed

第二十六章：床上的地图

An hour later. The mood shifted from tender to sharp.

一小时后。气氛从温存转为锐利。

They lay on the bed, naked, limbs entangled. The air conditioning hummed softly.

他们赤裸地躺在床上，四肢交缠。空调轻声嗡嗡作响。

Miyetsuko traced a pattern on Chen Mo's chest with her finger.

美悦子用手指在陈默的胸口画着图案。

"It's time, Chen," she said, her voice clear and steady.

“到时候了，陈，”她说，声音清晰而坚定。

"Time for what?" Chen Mo stroked her hair, still basking in the afterglow.

“什么到时候了？”陈默抚摸着她的头发，还沉浸在余韵中。

"Time to stop running. Time to go back."

“停止逃跑的时候。回去的时候。”

She sat up, the sheet sliding down to her waist. Her back was straight, her posture regaining its regal elegance.

她坐起来，床单滑落到腰间。她的背挺得笔直，姿态恢复了女王般的优雅。

"Kurosaki thinks he scared us into hiding in the jungle. He thinks he sent us running with our tails between our legs."

“黑崎以为他把我们吓得躲进了丛林。他以为他把我们要么打跑了，要么吓得夹着尾巴做人。”

She reached for the nightstand and pulled out a map. Not of Rio. But of Tokyo.

她伸手去摸床头柜，拿出了一张地图。不是里约的。是东京的。

"But he forgot one thing. The jungle changes people. It turns prey into predators."

“但他忘了一件事。丛林会改变人。它把猎物变成掠食者。”

She spread the map on the bed, right between their naked bodies. She pointed to a location in the Tokyo Bay area.

她把地图铺在床上，就在两人赤裸的身体之间。她指着东京湾区的一个位置。

"We have Fantasma's route now. We have the port codes. We have an army of mercenaries who will do anything for money."

“我们现在掌握了幽灵的航线。我们有港口代码。我们有一支为了钱什么都肯干的雇佣兵军队。”

Chen Mo sat up too. He looked at the map, then at her. The softness in her eyes was gone, replaced by a cold fire. But seeing her naked body, still flushed from their intimacy, plotting a war... it was incredibly arousing.

陈默也坐了起来。他看着地图，又看着她。她眼里的柔软消失了，取而代之的是冷火。但看着她赤裸的身体，还带着刚才亲热后的潮红，却在策划一场战争……这让他感到无比的兴奋。

"We aren't going back as refugees," Chen Mo realized her plan.

“我们不是以难民的身份回去，”陈默意识到了她的计划。

"No," Miyetsuko smiled. "We are going back as an invasion force."

“不，”美悦子笑了。“我们是以入侵者的身份回去。”

"We will smuggle ourselves in using Fantasma's container ship. Not cocaine. Soldiers. Weapons. And us."

“我们会利用幽灵的集装箱船把自己偷渡回去。不装可卡因。装士兵。装武器。还有我们。”

She leaned over the map, her breasts brushing against the paper. She tapped a red circle on the map—Kurosaki's private island estate.

她俯身在地图上，乳房擦过纸面。她点了点地图上的一个红圈——黑崎的私人岛屿庄园。

"He is celebrating his birthday next week. All the politicians, all the partners... everyone will be there."

“下周他要庆祝生日。所有的政客，所有的合作伙伴……所有人都会在那儿。”

"A birthday surprise?" Chen Mo smirked, putting his hand on her waist.

“生日惊喜？”陈默坏笑，手放在她的腰上。

"The biggest candle he has ever seen," Miyetsuko kissed him. "We are going to burn his house down. With him inside."

“他见过的最大的蜡烛，”美悦子吻了他。“我们要烧了他的房子。连同他在内。”
