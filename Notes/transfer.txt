Chapter 67: The Incense of Victory

第六十七章：胜利的线香

The priest finished chanting. It was time for the family to offer incense.

僧侣念完了经。到了家属上香的时候。

Miyetsuko stepped forward.

美悦子走上前。

She picked up a pinch of incense. The smell was cloying—sandalwood and death.

她抓起一撮线香。味道令人作呕——檀香和死亡的味道。

She looked at the black urn. Inside was the man who had bought her, raped her, and terrorized her for seven years. Now, he was just ash in a ceramic jar.

她看着那个黑色的骨灰盒。里面装着那个买下她、强暴她、恐吓了她七年的男人。现在，他只是陶瓷罐里的一把灰。

She brought her face close to the urn, pretending to whisper a final goodbye.

她把脸凑近骨灰盒，假装在低语最后的道别。

"I hope the fire hurt," she whispered, her voice soft as a lover's caress. "I hope you screamed my name in hell."

“希望那火烧得很疼，”她低语，声音轻柔得像情人的爱抚。“希望你在地狱里尖叫着我的名字。”

She dropped the incense into the burner. Smoke curled up, masking her face.

她把线香扔进香炉。烟雾缭绕，遮住了她的脸。

She turned around to face the crowd. Through the lace veil, she saw Mishima standing in the front row. He wasn't looking at the urn. He was looking at her.

她转身面对人群。透过蕾丝面纱，她看到三岛站在第一排。他没看骨灰盒。他在看她。

His eyes were cold. Calculating. He knew.

他的眼神冰冷。充满算计。他知道。
