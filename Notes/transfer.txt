Chapter 8: The Blind Spot of Arrogance

第八章：傲慢的盲区

Chen Mo did not lose his mind despite the temptation close at hand. He stepped back, escaping the suffocatingly sweet pressure, his eyes sharp.

陈默没有因为近在咫尺的诱惑而冲昏头脑。他退后一步，从那股窒息的香甜压迫中挣脱出来，眼神锐利。

"Wait. There is a logical flaw in your plan." Chen Mo stared at her. "You just said, 'Anyone you contact in Tokyo will be reported.' I walked in here with your card, through the front door. The surveillance cameras outside definitely captured me. If your husband is really that terrifying, I'm probably already a dead man."

“等等。你的计划有个逻辑漏洞。”陈默盯着她。“你刚才说，‘你在东京接触的任何人都会被汇报’。我拿着你的卡，大摇大摆走进这里。外面的监控肯定拍到了我。如果你丈夫真那么可怕，我现在恐怕已经是个死人了。”

Miyetsuko froze for a moment, then a look of appreciation flashed in her eyes. She laughed, a low, trembling laugh that caused the heavy softness beneath the silk dress to quake violently.

美悦子愣了一下，随即眼中闪过一丝赞赏。她笑了起来，笑声低沉，震得那丝绸裙下沉甸甸的软肉一阵剧烈乱颤。

"Smart man. I really didn't choose the wrong person."
“聪明的男人。我果然没选错人。”

She walked back to the sofa and sat down, crossing her legs. The high slit of her skirt slid down, revealing a large expanse of dazzlingly white thigh flesh, rich and tight, like creamy pudding solidified.

她走回沙发坐下，翘起二郎腿。高开叉的裙摆滑落，露出一大片晃眼的大腿软肉，丰腴紧致，像凝固的奶油布丁。

"They certainly know you're here. In fact, the report is probably already on the old man's desk: 'Mrs. Kurosaki met a young man in a private club.'" She took a drag from her cigarette, her expression turning sarcastic. "But you don't understand men like Kurosaki. Or rather, you don't understand the arrogance of power."

“他们当然知道你在这儿。事实上，报告可能已经放在那个老头子的桌上了：‘黑崎夫人在私人俱乐部见了一个年轻男人’。”她吸了一口烟，神情变得讥讽。“但你不了解黑崎那种男人。或者说，你不了解权力的傲慢。”

"What do you mean?"

“什么意思？”

"To him, I am just a canary he keeps in a cage. If I meet a politician, a business rival, or a journalist, he will be alert, he will kill. But you?" Miyetsuko looked Chen Mo up and down with a teasing gaze. "You are just a nobody, a corporate slave with a clean background."

“对他来说，我只是他养在笼子里的一只金丝雀。如果我见的是政客、商业对手或者记者，他会警觉，会杀人。但是你？”美悦子用一种玩味的目光上下打量陈默。“你只是个无名小卒，一个背景干净的社畜。”

She stood up again, her voice dipping into a hush.

她再次站起身，声音低了下去。

"If I meet you for 'business,' he will suspect. But if I meet you for... 'lust'? He will only think his pet is in heat and looking for a toy to relieve boredom. He despises my body, so he thinks everyone who covets my body is lowly and harmless."

“如果我和你谈‘生意’，他会起疑。但如果我是为了……‘欲望’呢？他只会觉得他的宠物发情了，找了个玩具解闷。他轻视我的身体，所以他觉得所有贪图我身体的人，都是低贱且无害的。”
