The Lost Key

Emma had just moved into a small, cozy apartment in the city. One evening, she realized she had lost the key to her front door. Panic set in as she retraced her steps: the grocery store, the bus stop, the park bench where she had read her book.

Just as she was about to call a locksmith, a little girl approached her. “Are you looking for this?” the girl asked, holding up a shiny key. Emma’s eyes widened in surprise and relief.

“Thank you so much! How did you find it?” Emma asked.

The girl smiled mysteriously. “I always notice things that others miss,” she said, and ran off into the evening light.

Emma unlocked her door, feeling that sometimes, help comes from the most unexpected places.
