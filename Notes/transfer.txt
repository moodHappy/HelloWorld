# The Missing Keys

I couldn't find my keys yesterday. I looked everywhere - in my bag, on the table, in my room. My keys were not there.

I asked my friend Tom, "Where are my keys?" He said, "I don't know."

Later, I remembered. I gave my keys to my sister yesterday. She needed to open the door for me.

I called my sister. "Thank you for keeping my keys," I said. She laughed, "You're welcome!"

I felt happy but a little silly. Always put your keys in the same place!
