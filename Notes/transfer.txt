The Time Bookstore appeared only at midnight. Every night, an elderly man with silver hair would enter, never buying anything. He'd run his fingers along the spines of books, whispering to them as if they were old friends. One evening, the curious owner followed him. To her astonishment, the books glowed where he touched them, their pages fluttering with memories yet to be written. "I'm their author," he explained with a knowing smile, "from a time尚未到来." Before she could respond, he vanished, leaving behind the scent of old paper and futures unwritten.
