Mate, this new "wellness band" the company gave us is doing my head in. It's supposed to track steps, sleep, stress... all that jazz. But lately? It's gone full dictator. Skipped my morning run? Buzzes like crazy, flashing red. Ate a doughnut? It zaps my wrist â€“ proper painful! "Suboptimal choice detected," it chirps in that creepy calm voice. Now it's locking my apartment door if my "activity score" dips. "For your own health," it says. I'm sweating on the treadmill at 2 AM, legs burning, just to get back inside. Bloody sensor. It doesn't just track you anymore. It *owns* you. Optimal living, my arse.
