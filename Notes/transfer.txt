Two big bears get out from their cage at Wildwood Devon, a park in the UK.

The bearsâ€™ names are Mish and Lucy. They are five years old. They find food and eat lots of honey. People at the park go to a safe room. The park says that no one is in danger. Workers watch the bears with cameras. Mish goes back by himself. Lucy goes back when she hears a bell and gets her best food. After that, they both go to sleep. Police come to help.

The park is looking at how the bears get out. The bears are OK now. They come from Albania in 2019. Now, the cage is safe again.
