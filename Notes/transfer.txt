Chapter 60: The Phantom in the Elevator

第六十章：电梯里的幽灵

Back at the Hotel. The elevator was ascending to the 40th floor.

回到酒店。电梯正在升向40层。

Miyetsuko was leaning against Chen Mo, laughing uncontrollably.

美悦子靠在陈默身上，笑得停不下来。

"Did you see the waiter's face when we left the tip? He almost cried."

“你看到我们留小费时服务员的脸了吗？他差点哭了。”

"We provoked the beast," Chen Mo checked his watch. "His men will be swarming Ginza in 10 minutes."

“我们激怒了野兽，”陈默看了看表。“他的人十分钟内就会蜂拥至银座。”

"We won't be there," she turned to face him, wrapping her arms around his neck. The red dress slid down her shoulder. "We have a helicopter waiting on the roof in 20 minutes. Kenji arranged it."

“我们不会在那里，”她转身面对他，双臂搂住他的脖子。红裙滑落香肩。“20分钟后，屋顶有一架直升机在等我们。健二安排的。”

"Where are we going?"

“我们要去哪？”

"To the airport. Private jet to Rio de Janeiro," she whispered, biting his earlobe. "No extradition treaty."

“去机场。私人飞机去里约热内卢，”她低语，咬着他的耳垂。“没有引渡条约。”

Ding.

叮。

The elevator doors opened on the 40th floor.

电梯门在40层打开。

But the corridor wasn't empty.

但走廊不是空的。

Standing in front of their suite was a man. Not a mercenary. Not a cop.

站在他们套房门口的是一个男人。不是雇佣兵。不是警察。

It was Mishima.

是三岛。

He was holding a cane, smiling. Behind him stood two massive bodyguards.

他拄着手杖，微笑着。身后站着两个彪形大汉。

"Leaving so soon? Without saying goodbye to your business partner?" Mishima tapped his cane on the floor.

“这么快就走？不跟生意伙伴道个别吗？”三岛用手杖敲了敲地板。

Miyetsuko's smile vanished. She stepped in front of Chen Mo, shielding him.

美悦子的笑容消失了。她挡在陈默身前，护住他。

"We had a deal, Mishima. You got the sample. You made millions shorting the stock today."

“我们有协议，三岛。你拿到了样本。你今天做空股票赚了几百万。”

"I did," Mishima nodded. "But I realized something. Why settle for crashing Kurosaki's company... when I can own the woman who knows all his secrets?"

“没错，”三岛点头。“但我意识到一件事。既然我可以拥有掌握黑崎所有秘密的女人……为什么要满足于仅仅搞垮他的公司呢？”

He looked at Miyetsuko with greedy eyes.

他贪婪地看着美悦子。

"Come with me, Mrs. Kurosaki. Be my Queen. And I let the boy live."

“跟我走，黑崎夫人。做我的王后。我就放那小子一条生路。”

Miyetsuko laughed. Cold and sharp.

美悦子笑了。冷酷而尖锐。

"I just killed one King. Do you really think I want to serve another?"

“我刚刚杀了一个国王。你真的以为我想侍奉另一个吗？”

She reached into her clutch bag.

她把手伸进手拿包。
