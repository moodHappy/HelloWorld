**NEWS REPORT: FAMINE DEVASTATES EASTERN PROVINCES AS WAR CONTINUES**

BERLIN â€“ The prolonged conflict between the Republic of Aldania and neighboring Veridia has entered its third year, with United Nations officials reporting catastrophic food shortages affecting millions. Agricultural regions have become battlegrounds, leaving fields untended and harvests destroyed. The Aldanian government confirmed yesterday that over 2 million citizens now face starvation as supply lines remain severed by Veridian forces. International aid organizations have been denied access to the hardest-hit eastern provinces. "This is a man-made disaster of unprecedented scale," stated UN Relief Coordinator Hans Mueller, as global leaders convene for emergency talks in Geneva.
