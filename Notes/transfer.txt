The Storyteller's Mask

Old Chen wore his carved wooden mask every evening in the town square. Behind the smiling face, he transformed into heroes, villains, and lovers, captivating the crowd with tales of ancient China. Children believed the mask held magic, but only Chen knew its truth. The mask freed him from his timid self, allowing his voice to boom with confidence. When stories ended, he carefully removed the mask, returning to his quiet existence. One evening, a young girl asked why he always covered his face. Chen smiled gently. "The mask doesn't hide me," he whispered. "It reveals who I truly am."
