Man, I was stuck in this insane traffic jam today. Rush hour in the city is always brutal, but this was next level. Cars weren't moving an inch! I'd been sitting there for like 30 minutes, and I was gonna be late for my meeting. Everyone was honking their horns, getting more frustrated by the second. I turned up the radio and tried to chill, but my patience was wearing thin. Finally, I saw some flashing lights ahead. Turned out there was a fender bender blocking two lanes. Typical! Just my luck. I swear, city driving will be the death of me.
