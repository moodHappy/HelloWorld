Chapter 66: The Sea of Umbrellas
第六十六章：伞的海洋
Aoyama Cemetery. Tokyo.
东京青山灵园。
The rain fell in sheets, turning the grey gravestones into slick, dark mirrors. A sea of black umbrellas bobbed in the mist. The elite of Japan—politicians, CEOs, Yakuza oyabuns—had gathered to bury Kurosaki Soichiro.
大雨倾盆，把灰色的墓碑变成了光滑、黑暗的镜子。一片黑伞的海洋在雾气中浮动。日本的精英——政客、CEO、极道组长——聚集在一起埋葬黑崎宗一郎。
Miyetsuko stood at the front.
美悦子站在最前面。
She wore a bespoke Givenchy mourning dress. It was black, modest, yet cut so precisely that it made every other woman look like they were wearing a sack. A veil of black lace covered her face, hiding her eyes.
她穿着一件纪梵希定制的丧服。全黑，端庄，但剪裁精准得让其他女人看起来像是穿着麻袋。一层黑色蕾丝面纱遮住了她的脸，藏起了她的眼睛。
People whispered. "The poor widow." "She looks devastated."
人们在低语。“可怜的寡妇。”“她看起来崩溃了。”
Under the veil, Miyetsuko was smiling.
在面纱下，美悦子在笑。
Chen Mo stood beside her, holding a large black umbrella over her head. He was dry. She was dry. The rest of the world was drowning.
陈默站在她身边，为她撑着一把巨大的黑伞。他是干的。她是干的。剩下的世界都在溺水。
Chapter 67: The Incense of Victory
第六十七章：胜利的线香
The priest finished chanting. It was time for the family to offer incense.
僧侣念完了经。到了家属上香的时候。
Miyetsuko stepped forward.
美悦子走上前。
She picked up a pinch of incense. The smell was cloying—sandalwood and death.
她抓起一撮线香。味道令人作呕——檀香和死亡的味道。
She looked at the black urn. Inside was the man who had bought her, raped her, and terrorized her for seven years. Now, he was just ash in a ceramic jar.
她看着那个黑色的骨灰盒。里面装着那个买下她、强暴她、恐吓了她七年的男人。现在，他只是陶瓷罐里的一把灰。
She brought her face close to the urn, pretending to whisper a final goodbye.
她把脸凑近骨灰盒，假装在低语最后的道别。
"I hope the fire hurt," she whispered, her voice soft as a lover's caress. "I hope you screamed my name in hell."
“希望那火烧得很疼，”她低语，声音轻柔得像情人的爱抚。“希望你在地狱里尖叫着我的名字。”
She dropped the incense into the burner. Smoke curled up, masking her face.
她把线香扔进香炉。烟雾缭绕，遮住了她的脸。
She turned around to face the crowd. Through the lace veil, she saw Mishima standing in the front row. He wasn't looking at the urn. He was looking at her.
她转身面对人群。透过蕾丝面纱，她看到三岛站在第一排。他没看骨灰盒。他在看她。
His eyes were cold. Calculating. He knew.
他的眼神冰冷。充满算计。他知道。
Chapter 68: The Umbrella Confrontation
第六十八章：伞下的对峙
As the crowd dispersed, Mishima walked up to her. His bodyguards flanked him, tense and ready.
人群散去时，三岛走向她。他的保镖护在两侧，紧绷着神经。
"A beautiful service, Mrs. Kurosaki," Mishima said, his voice low. "Or should I say... Mrs. Tanaka?"
“葬礼很美，黑崎夫人，”三岛低声说。“或者我该叫你……田中太太？”
"Miyetsuko is fine," she replied calmly. Chen Mo stepped slightly forward, placing himself between Mishima and her.
“叫美悦子就好，”她平静地回答。陈默稍微上前一步，挡在她和三岛之间。
"He died at a very... convenient time," Mishima looked at Chen Mo, then back at her. "Just as you returned. Just as the security system failed."
“他死得非常……及时，”三岛看了看陈默，又看回她。“就在你回来的时候。就在安保系统失效的时候。”
"Life is full of coincidences, Mishima-san," she lifted her veil.
“生活充满了巧合，三岛先生，”她掀起了面纱。
Her face was dry. Her makeup was perfect. Her lips were a shocking shade of red.
她的脸是干的。妆容完美。嘴唇涂着令人震惊的红色。
"And death... is full of opportunities."
“而死亡……充满了机遇。”
Mishima stepped closer. The rain drummed harder on the umbrellas.
三岛逼近一步。雨点更猛烈地敲打着伞面。
"You think you won because the old dog is dead? I am not Kurosaki. I don't want to break you. I want to erase you."
“你以为老狗死了你就赢了？我不是黑崎。我不想折磨你。我想抹除你。”
Miyetsuko laughed. A genuine, light laugh that echoed in the cemetery.
美悦子笑了。一声真诚、轻快的笑声在墓地回荡。
"Try it," she whispered. "But remember, I have the jungle in my blood now. And in the jungle... the predator doesn't roar before it bites."
“试试看，”她低语。“但记住，我的血里现在流淌着丛林。而在丛林里……掠食者咬人之前是不会吼叫的。”
She turned her back on him.
她背过身去。
"Let's go, Chen. The air here stinks of yesterday."
“走吧，陈。这儿的空气有一股昨天的臭味。”
Chapter 69: The Drive to Freedom
第六十九章：通往自由的车程
Inside the back of the Maybach, the silence was heavy.
迈巴赫的后座里，沉默很沉重。
Chen Mo drove. The partition was down.
陈默在开车。隔板降下了。
Miyetsuko sat in the back. She pulled the black veil off her head and threw it on the floor. She kicked off her heels.
美悦子坐在后面。她扯下头上的黑色面纱，扔在地板上。踢掉了高跟鞋。
She looked at her reflection in the rearview mirror. For the first time in seven years, she didn't see a victim. She didn't see a wife. She saw herself.
她看着后视镜里的倒影。七年来第一次，她没看到受害者。没看到妻子。她看到了她自己。
"Chen," she said softly.
“陈，”她轻声唤道。
"I'm here."
“我在。”
"Pull over."
“停车。”
"Here? It's the highway."
“这儿？这是高速公路。”
"Pull over."
“停车。”
Chen Mo pulled the car onto the shoulder of the rain-slicked highway, overlooking the Tokyo Tower.
陈默把车停在雨水湿滑的高速公路路肩上，俯瞰着东京塔。
He turned around.
他转过身。
Miyetsuko climbed over the center console into the front seat. She straddled him, right there in the driver's seat, the rain pounding on the roof.
美悦子爬过中控台，钻进前座。她跨坐在他身上，就在驾驶座上，大雨敲打着车顶。
She grabbed his face and kissed him. It was a desperate, hungry kiss. She tasted of tears she hadn't shed and freedom she hadn't tasted.
她捧住他的脸吻他。那是一个绝望、饥渴的吻。她尝起来有未流的泪水和未曾尝过的自由。
"He's gone, Chen. He's really gone," she sobbed into his neck, her body shaking.
“他没了，陈。他真的没了，”她在他脖颈处啜泣，身体颤抖。
"He's gone," Chen Mo held her tight, stroking her hair. "You are free."
“他没了，”陈默紧紧抱着她，抚摸着她的头发。“你自由了。”
She pulled back, her eyes red but shining. She reached for the ruby choker on her neck—the one Chen Mo gave her on the plane.
她退后一点，眼睛红了但闪着光。她伸手摸向脖子上的红宝石项圈——那是陈默在飞机上给她的。
"This isn't a leash anymore," she touched the gem. "It's a trophy."
“这不再是狗链了，”她摸着宝石。“这是战利品。”
"And what do you want to do with your freedom, Queen?" Chen Mo wiped a tear from her cheek.
“那你打算用你的自由做什么，女王？”陈默擦掉她脸颊上的一滴泪。
She looked out the window at the Tokyo Tower, glowing red in the mist. Then she looked at the Mishima Heavy Industries building in the distance—a black obelisk piercing the sky.
她看向窗外的东京塔，在雾中发出红光。然后她看向远处的三岛重工大楼——一座刺破天空的黑色方尖碑。
She smiled. The tears stopped. The predator returned.
她笑了。眼泪停了。掠食者回来了。
"I want it all, Chen."
“我全都要，陈。”
"I want to burn Mishima down. I want to build my own empire on his ashes. And I want you standing right next to me when I do it."
“我要烧了三岛。我要在他的灰烬上建立我自己的帝国。而我要你站在我身边，看着我做这一切。”
Chen Mo smirked. He started the engine. The V12 roared to life.
陈默坏笑了一下。发动引擎。V12引擎咆哮着苏醒。
"Your wish is my command."
“如你所愿。”
Chapter 70 (Epilogue): The Throne Room
第七十章（尾声）：王座厅
Kurosaki Heavy Industries. CEO's Office.
黑崎重工。CEO办公室。
The name on the door had already been changed. Miyetsuko Tanaka-Kurosaki.
门上的名字已经换了。田中-黑崎美悦子。
She walked in. The office was vast, cold, and smelled of old power.
她走了进去。办公室巨大、冰冷，闻起来有旧权力的味道。
She walked to the massive oak desk where Kurosaki used to sign death warrants. She ran her hand over the wood.
她走到那张巨大的橡木桌前，黑崎曾经在那里签署死亡令。她的手抚过木面。
She didn't sit in the chair immediately.
她没有立刻坐下。
She turned to the window. Tokyo lay beneath her feet.
她转向窗户。东京就在她脚下。
"Season 2 is over, Chen," she whispered to the reflection of the man standing by the door.
“第二季结束了，陈，”她对着门口那个男人的倒影低语。
Chen Mo locked the door. Click.
陈默锁上了门。咔哒。
"Ready for Season 3?"
“准备好第三季了吗？”
Miyetsuko sat down in the leather chair. She spun it around. She crossed her legs, the black dress riding up high. She leaned back, interlacing her fingers, looking every inch the boss.
美悦子在那张真皮椅子上坐下。转过身来。她翘起二郎腿，黑色裙摆滑得很高。她向后靠，十指交叉，看起来完全是个老板。
She picked up the phone.
她拿起电话。
"Get me Mishima," she said into the receiver. "Tell him the Queen is on the line. And she's hungry."
“给我接三岛，”她对着话筒说。“告诉他，女王在线。而且她饿了。”
