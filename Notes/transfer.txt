# Blood-Colored Dusk

The blood-red sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of crimson and violet. Old Man Li stood at his farmhouse window, watching the eerie display. This sunset had been different—darker, more menacing than usual. He remembered the legends from his childhood, tales of how blood-red foretold of coming violence. Suddenly, a distant scream pierced the evening air. His heart raced as he reached for the old shotgun resting by the door. The dusk had never looked so threatening, nor had the night ahead ever seemed so long.
