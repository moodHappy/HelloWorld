Elena stood at the crossroads as midnight chimed. A shadow emerged, offering her heart's desire - musical talent that would make her famous - in exchange for her soul.

"For seven years," she negotiated, "then you collect."

The shadow agreed. Seven years passed. Elena became a renowned composer, her music touching millions. As the final hour approached, she wrote her masterpiece - a symphony so beautiful it moved the shadow to tears.

"I cannot take such talent," it whispered, vanishing into the night. Elena smiled, having outsmarted darkness itself with the power of her art.
