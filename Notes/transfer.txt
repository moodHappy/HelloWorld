Chapter 36: The Kevlar Corset

第三十六章：凯夫拉紧身胸衣

Miyetsuko dropped her robe. It pooled on the floor like spilled milk.

美悦子让睡袍滑落。它像泼洒的牛奶一样堆在地板上。

She stood naked in the dim light. Her body was a landscape of soft curves and hidden strength. But there was no time for luxury now.

她在昏暗的光线中赤裸站立。她的身体是一幅由柔软曲线和隐藏力量构成的风景画。但现在没时间享受奢华了。

Chen Mo opened the duffel bag. He didn't take out diamonds. He took out a black tactical bodysuit and a lightweight Kevlar vest.

陈默打开行李袋。拿出的不是钻石。而是一件黑色战术紧身衣和一件轻型凯夫拉防弹背心。

"Arms up," he commanded softly.

“抬手，”他轻声命令。

She obeyed. He slid the tactical suit up her legs. The fabric was tight, designed to compress muscles for endurance. As he pulled it over her hips, his hands lingered for a second on her warm skin, feeling the pulse in her femoral artery.

她照做了。他将战术服顺着她的腿向上拉。布料很紧，设计用来压缩肌肉以增加耐力。当他把衣服拉过她的臀部时，他的手在她温暖的皮肤上停留了一秒，感受着她股动脉的跳动。

"It's tight," she whispered, her breath hitching as the fabric squeezed her waist.

“好紧，”她低语，当布料勒紧她的腰时，呼吸停滞了一下。

"It needs to be," Chen Mo stood behind her, zipping up the back.

“必须紧，”陈默站在她身后，拉上背后的拉链。

The zipper sound was sharp in the quiet room. The black suit covered her from neck to ankle, turning her silhouette into a shadow. But the front was low-cut, a small concession to comfort—or distraction.

拉链声在安静的房间里很刺耳。黑色的紧身衣从脖子覆盖到脚踝，把她的剪影变成了影子。但前胸是低领设计，这是对舒适度——或者是为了让人分心——的一点小让步。

Chen Mo picked up the Kevlar vest. It was molded to fit a female form, but barely.

陈默拿起防弹背心。它是按照女性体型模压的，但也只是勉强合身。

He placed it over her chest. He tightened the velcro straps on the sides.

他把它套在她胸前。拉紧侧面的魔术贴带子。

Rrrrip. The sound of velcro.

撕拉。 魔术贴的声音。

He pulled it tight. Very tight. The vest pushed her breasts up and together, compressing them safely against her chest wall.

他拉得很紧。非常紧。背心把她的乳房向上推挤并聚拢，将它们安全地压在胸壁上。

"Can you breathe?" he asked, his face close to hers.

“能呼吸吗？”他问，脸贴得很近。

"Barely," she looked up at him. Her eyes were dilated. The constriction of the armor, the pressure on her chest, the anticipation of violence... it was a different kind of arousal. "It feels like... a hug. A hard one."

“勉强，”她抬头看他。瞳孔放大。盔甲的束缚，胸口的压力，对暴力的预感……这是一种别样的兴奋。“感觉像……一个拥抱。很硬的那种。”

Chen Mo reached down and strapped a holster to her thigh. He slid the gold-plated derringer into it. Then he handed her a Glock 19.

陈默弯腰，在她大腿上绑上枪套。把那把镀金德林加滑进去。然后递给她一把格洛克19。

"This isn't a toy tonight," he checked the slide. "The Butcher is coming. He wants to cut us."

“今晚这不是玩具，”他检查了套筒。“屠夫来了。他想把我们要大卸八块。”

Miyetsuko took the gun. The cold steel felt heavy in her hand.

美悦子接过枪。冰冷的钢铁在手里感觉很沉。

She stepped closer to Chen Mo, the hard Kevlar of her vest bumping against his chest. She reached up and touched his face.

她向陈默靠近一步，坚硬的防弹背心撞击着他的胸口。她伸手摸了摸他的脸。

"Then we cut him first," she whispered, her lips brushing his ear. "And when we survive this... you can take this armor off me. Slowly. With your teeth."

“那我们就先切了他，”她耳语，嘴唇擦过他的耳朵。“等我们活下来……你可以帮我脱掉这身盔甲。慢慢地。用你的牙齿。”

Chen Mo grabbed the back of her neck and kissed her fiercely. It wasn't gentle. It was a transfer of energy. A promise of violence.

陈默扣住她的后颈，狠狠吻了她。不温柔。这是能量的传递。是暴力的承诺。

"Let's go hunting."

“去狩猎吧。”
