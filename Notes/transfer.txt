# Family and Kinship

My family's not perfect, but we got each other's backs. Last Sunday, my grandma called saying her TV wasn't working. My brother dropped everything and drove across town to fix it. Turned out it was just unplugged! But he didn't mind. Later that night, we all gathered for her famous dumplings. Laughter filled her small apartment as we shared stories and teased each other. That's what family's all about - showing up, even for the little things. Blood might make us related, but love keeps us connected.
