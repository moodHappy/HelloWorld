So I was wandering around Shanghai yesterday, totally turned around. My phone was dying and I had no idea where I was. Spotting an elderly lady selling street food, I approached her nervously.

"Excuse me, could you help me find the metro station?" I asked in broken Chinese.

She smiled warmly and pointed down an alley. "Go straight, then turn left at the big red building. You can't miss it!"

Her directions were spot on! I thanked her profusely and made it to my appointment just in time. Funny how a simple question can save your day when you're lost in a big city.
