The Panama Canal connects two oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. In 1913, workers must flood Lake Gatun to make the canal.

The canal is very important for global trade. Big ships go through the canal. The canal makes the way much shorter. But there is a problem â€“ not enough rain. This year, the canal has very low water. You can even see trees in the water. It is not usual. This makes it hard for ships to pass. They have to go around Africa or Egypt. It takes more time and money.

This problem will get worse because Central America will have even less rain in the future. Experts do not know how to solve it or if it is even possible.
