You won't believe how lazy I can be! I bought this fancy electric toothbrush, right? Used it for a week until the battery died. And get this - I was too lazy to charge it! For a whole month, I just used it like a regular toothbrush, moving it back and forth manually. My friend saw me and was like, "Why don't you just charge it?" I just shrugged and said, "Eh, too much effort." Finally charged it yesterday when my arm started getting tired. Yeah, I might have a laziness problem!
