The Late Bus

末班车

The bus arrived five minutes late, as it usually did.

公交车迟到了五分钟，和往常一样。

No one complained.

没有人抱怨。

At this hour, people accepted delay as part of the route.

在这个时段，延误本来就是路线的一部分。

Marcus stood near the shelter, counting the coins in his palm for the third time.

马库斯站在站台边，把掌心的硬币数了第三遍。

He already knew they were enough.

他早就知道钱是够的。

Counting was a way to stay occupied.

反复清点，只是为了让自己有事可做。

A woman stood a few steps away from him, facing the road.

不远处站着一名女人，面向马路。

She wore a dark coat and held a folded receipt instead of a phone.

她穿着深色外套，手里攥着一张折起来的小票，而不是手机。

She looked like someone waiting, but not impatiently.

她看起来在等什么，却一点也不着急。

Marcus noticed this because most people were always checking the time.

马库斯注意到这一点，是因为其他人几乎都在看时间。

The bus headlights appeared at the end of the street.

公交车的车灯出现在街道尽头。

The woman shifted her weight slightly, then stepped forward.

那女人微微换了下重心，向前走了一步。

Marcus followed, not because he needed to, but because everyone else did.

马库斯也跟着上前，不是因为必要，而是因为所有人都动了。

Inside the bus, the air smelled faintly of damp coats and old fabric.

车厢里有股潮湿外套和旧布料混合的气味。

They found seats near the middle, not next to each other.

他们在车厢中段各自坐下，没有挨在一起。

At the next stop, a man got on and hesitated, scanning the aisle.

下一站，一个男人上了车，在过道里犹豫着四处看。

“You can sit there,” the woman said, pointing to the empty seat beside her.

“你可以坐那儿。”女人说，指了指她旁边的空位。

Her voice was calm, practiced.

她的声音很平稳，像是说过很多次。

The man thanked her and sat down.

男人道了谢，坐了下来。

Marcus watched this exchange without interest, then turned to the window.

马库斯看了一眼这段对话，没太在意，转头看向窗外。

The city passed by in fragments—closed shops, lit kitchens, reflections of faces.

城市以碎片的形式掠过——关门的商店、亮着灯的厨房、玻璃上的人影。

Two stops later, the woman stood up.

两站之后，女人站起身。

She moved quickly, as if she had almost missed it.

她动作很快，像是差点坐过站。

As she passed Marcus, she nodded once, without looking directly at him.

经过马库斯身边时，她轻轻点了下头，却没有直视他。

He nodded back, a second too late.

他也点了点头，慢了半拍。

By the time the doors closed again, she was already part of the street.

车门再次关上时，她已经融入了街道。

Marcus did not know her name.

马库斯不知道她叫什么。

He would not remember her face clearly by morning.

到第二天早上，他大概也记不清她的样子了。

But for the rest of the ride, he sat a little straighter.

但在接下来的路程里，他坐得比刚才更直了一些。
