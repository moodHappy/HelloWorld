Chapter 8: A Token of Obsession

第八章：执念的信物

Shiraishi pulled away slightly, his breath still ragged. He reached for his phone but didn't open the camera. Instead, he just looked at Miyetsuko, who was leaning against the cold slide, trying to regain her composure. "The photo," he started, his voice low and steady. "I'm not going to show anyone. I just want it as a souvenir."

白石稍微退后了一点，呼吸依然粗重。他摸向手机，但没打开相机，只是看着倚在冰冷滑梯上努力平复心情的美悦子。“照片的事，”他开口道，声音低沉而稳重，“我不会给任何人看。我只是想把它当成一个纪念。”

"A souvenir?" Miyetsuko repeated, her voice trembling slightly from the cold. Shiraishi nodded, his thumb tracing the line of her jaw. "Yeah. To remind me of this version of you. The one that only I get to see. The girl who isn't always the perfect, quiet student."

“纪念？”美悦子重复道，声音因为寒冷而微微发颤。白石点了点头，大拇指勾勒着她的下颚线。“嗯。为了提醒我你的这一面。那个只有我能见到的你。那个并不总是完美、文静的学生妹。”

Miyetsuko looked at him, searching his eyes for any hint of a threat, but she only found a raw, hungry kind of devotion. In a world that was falling apart at home, this secret digital memento felt like an anchor. It was a piece of her that belonged entirely to him, far away from the unpaid bills and her parents' tired faces.

美悦子看着他，想从他眼中寻找到一丝威胁的痕迹，却只发现了一种原始而饥渴的深情。在那个支离破碎的家里，这份秘密的电子纪念品反而像个锚点。那是她身上完全属于他的一部分，远离了那些欠费账单和父母疲惫的面孔。

"Just don't let anyone find it," she whispered, leaning her head against his shoulder. Shiraishi wrapped his arms around her, shielding her from the biting wind. "I'll guard it with my life," he promised, though they both knew that in their world, secrets were the most volatile things of all.

“别让任何人发现就行，”她轻声说着，把头抵在他的肩膀上。白石伸手环抱住她，为她挡住刺骨的寒风。“我会用命守着它，”他承诺道，尽管他们心里都清楚，在他们的世界里，秘密是最不稳定的东西。
