In a heartwarming discovery yesterday, local resident Zhang Wei found his late grandfather's 50-year-old leather shoes hidden in the attic. The worn footwear, crafted by hand in 1973, carries profound family significance. "These shoes walked my grandfather through three decades of hard work," Zhang explained. The shoes, remarkably preserved despite their age, display intricate stitching and bear the marks of countless journeys. Family historians note that similar footwear artifacts provide valuable insights into traditional Chinese craftsmanship. Zhang plans to donate the shoes to the City Museum, where they will join an exhibition celebrating everyday objects that shaped local history.
