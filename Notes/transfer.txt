Li slid into Wang's DMs: "Hey, wanna date?" When she didn't reply, he added, "Come on, let's give it a shot."

Wang finally responded: "I'm already seeing someone."

Li's brain short-circuited. "Wait, what? I don't believe you. Who's this mystery person you're hiding?"

"It's complicated," Wang typed. "Not really something you post about on social media."

Li pressed for details. After a long pause, Wang dropped the bomb: "I'm the other woman."

Li stared at his screen, wondering if he should be impressed or horrified. "Well," he finally typed, "at least you're honest about your dishonesty."
