My Father the King

Growing up in the palace, I often watched my father rule with wisdom and grace. Though crown weighed heavy on his brow, his eyes sparkled when he saw me. "You are my greatest treasure," he'd say, setting aside royal decrees to listen to my childhood tales. The kingdom saw a monarch; I saw a father who taught me courage through his actions and compassion through his decrees. On his deathbed, he whispered, "Rule your heart as I ruled the kingdom." Now wearing his crown, I understand: a king's true legacy isn't power, but love passed down through generations.
