Chapter 11: The Night Watchman’s Pleasure

第十一章：守夜人的欢愉

Part 1: The Gate at Midnight

午夜的门岗

Saori arrived at the Lin estate long after the city had gone quiet. Her grey silk coat was buttoned haphazardly, hiding the shredded remains of her blouse. She looked like a fallen angel seeking sanctuary in a graveyard.

沙织回到林家大宅时，城市早已沉寂。她的灰色丝绸大衣扣得凌乱不堪，遮掩着里面破碎的衬衫。她看起来像个落难的天使，在墓地中寻求避难所。

The heavy iron gates were locked. Sato, the middle-aged gateman, stepped out of his small stone lodge. He smelled of cheap sake and boredom. When the light of his flashlight hit Saori’s face, he saw the smeared lipstick and the vacant, haunting beauty of her eyes.

沉重的铁门锁着。中年门房佐藤从他的小石屋里走了出来。他身上带着廉价清酒的味道和乏闷的气息。当手电筒的光扫过沙织的脸时，他看到了抹开的口红，以及她眼中那空洞、勾魂的美。

"Back late, aren't we, Miss Mikage?" Sato rasped. He noticed the way she shivered, the way the silk clung to her damp, bruised skin. He didn't see a superior; he saw a woman who had already been broken tonight.

“回来晚了啊，御影小姐？”佐藤沙哑地说道。他注意到她颤抖的样子，注意到丝绸如何紧贴着她潮湿、带青紫的肌肤。他没看到上司，他只看到一个今晚已经被玩坏了的女人。

Part 2: The Low Octave

低八度的诱惑

Sato didn't open the main gate. Instead, he reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her toward the dim yellow light of his guardroom. "You look like you need to warm up before you see the Master."

佐藤没有打开大门。相反，他伸手抓住了她纤细的手腕，将她拽向门卫室昏黄的灯光。“见老爷之前，你看起来需要先暖和暖和。”

Saori didn't resist. She never did. When Sato’s rough, calloused hand tightened on her arm, she simply offered that faint, tragic smile. He was a nobody, a servant of the house, but in this moment, his voice was the only command she had.

沙织没有反抗，她从不反抗。当佐藤粗糙、布满老茧的手在她胳膊上收紧时，她只是露出了那抹淡淡的、悲剧性的微笑。他是个无名小卒，是家里的仆人，但在这一刻，他的声音是她接到的唯一指令。

He pushed her onto the narrow, creaking cot. The room smelled of sweat and old grease. "I've watched you for a long time, Miss Mikage," he whispered, his hand diving under her skirt. "Now, let's see what the big bosses have been enjoying."

他把她推到那张狭窄、嘎吱作响的简易床上。屋里弥漫着汗臭和陈旧的油脂味。“我盯着你很久了，御影小姐，”他低声说着，手伸进了她的裙底。“现在，让我看看那些大老板们一直在享受什么。”

Part 3: The Raw Release

原始的发泄

He didn't waste time with words. He unzipped his trousers and forced her legs apart, his knees pinning her against the thin mattress. Saori lay back, her hair spilling over the dirty pillow like a halo of ruined silk.

他没有在言语上浪费时间。他拉开裤子拉链，强行分开了她的双腿，用膝盖将她压在薄薄的床垫上。沙织仰躺着，头发像一圈毁掉的丝绸光环散落在肮脏的枕头上。

When he thrust into her, his entry was blunt and vulgar, a stark contrast to the cold precision of the men upstairs. Saori’s eyes rolled back as she absorbed the shock of his thick, unwashed heat. Her body, conditioned by a dozen masters, responded instantly. A deep, honeyed moan escaped her throat—a sound of pure,入骨 (bone-deep) eroticism that filled the cramped room.

当他刺入时，他的进入粗鲁而庸俗，与楼上那些男人的冷酷精确形成鲜明对比。当沙织承受着他那粗厚、未洗涤的热力冲击时，她的双眼向上翻起。她那被一打主人调教过的身体瞬间产生了反应。一声深沉、如蜜般酥麻的呻吟从她喉咙里溢出——那是一种纯粹、入骨的官能之声，充斥了狭窄的房间。

Sato groaned, his hands clutching her breasts, squeezing the delicate flesh until it reddened. He moved with a frantic, desperate hunger, his hips slamming against hers with a wet, smacking rhythm. Saori didn't look at him, but her legs wrapped around his waist, her pelvis tilted to meet every heavy stroke. She was a hollow vessel, being filled by the lowest man in the estate, yet the pleasure was real, a violent hum in her nerves.

佐藤呻吟着，双手揉捏着她的乳房，用力挤压着娇嫩的肉，直到发红。他带着一种疯狂、绝望的饥渴律动着，臀部以一种湿润、啪嗒作响的节奏撞击着她。沙织没有看他，但她的双腿缠住了他的腰，骨盆倾斜着去迎接每一次沉重的抽送。她是一个空洞的容器，正被这领地里地位最低的男人填充，然而那快感是真实的，在她的神经中剧烈轰鸣。

Part 4: The Afterglow of the Guardroom

岗亭的余温

As Sato reached his peak, he let out a guttural shout, his seed flooding her with a raw, stinging warmth. He collapsed onto her, his heavy breath hot against her ear. Saori lay still, her chest heaving, the scent of the gateman now mixed with the expensive cologne of Soichiro Kurosaki.

当佐藤达到顶峰时，他发出一声低哑的吼叫，精液带着原始、灼热的快感淹没了她。他瘫倒在她身上，沉重的呼吸热烘烘地喷在她耳边。沙织静静地躺着，胸口起伏，门房身上的味道此刻与黑崎宗一郎那昂贵的古龙水味混合在一起。

She waited for him to move, her eyes staring at a crack in the ceiling. She was a map of the world’s lust, marked by every class of man.

她等着他离开，双眼盯着天花板上的一条裂缝。她是这个世界欲望的地图，被每一个阶层的男人标记过。

"You can go now," Sato muttered, pulling away and adjusting his clothes. He felt a strange sense of victory, having possessed the woman the masters prized.

“你可以走了，”佐藤咕哝着，退身坐起整理衣服。他感到一种奇异的胜利感，因为他占有了那些主子们视如珍宝的女人。

Saori stood up and straightened her torn silk. Her face was calm, her beauty untouched by the filth of the room. "Thank you, Sato-san," she whispered, her voice a ghost of a melody.

沙织站起身，整理好撕裂的丝绸。她的脸色平静，她的美貌未被房间的污秽所玷污。“谢谢你，佐藤先生，”她轻声呢喃，声音如幽灵般的旋律。

She walked out of the guardhouse and toward the main mansion. She had a message to deliver: the Lin family was safe for now. But as she walked, the wet evidence of her journey dripped down her inner thigh, a silent reminder of the price of peace.

她走出岗亭，走向主宅。她有一个消息要传达：林家暂时安全了。但当她行走时，旅途中那湿热的证据正顺着她的内腿滑落，无声地提醒着和平的代价。
