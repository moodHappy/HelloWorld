Chapter 1: 38 Degrees Celsius

第一章：摄氏38度

Six months later. Rio de Janeiro.

六个月后。里约热内卢。

The sun hung directly overhead, baking the white sand of Copacabana Beach. The air shimmered with heat distortion, smelling of salt, coconuts, and cheap sunscreen.

太阳直直地挂在头顶，炙烤着科帕卡巴纳海滩的白沙。空气因为热浪而扭曲，弥漫着盐、椰子和廉价防晒霜的味道。

In a private villa halfway up the hill, overlooking the ocean, the air conditioning was fighting a losing battle.

在半山腰一座俯瞰大海的私人别墅里，空调正在进行一场注定失败的战斗。

Miyetsuko lay on a lounge chair by the infinity pool.

美悦子躺在无边泳池旁的躺椅上。

She had changed. The Tokyo pallor was gone, replaced by a light, honey-colored tan. It made her look healthier, wilder. She wore a gold string bikini that was essentially three triangles of fabric holding back a landslide.

她变了。东京时期的苍白消失了，取而代之的是一层淡淡的、蜂蜜色的晒痕。这让她看起来更健康、更野性。她穿着一套金色的细绳比基尼，基本上就是三块布料在勉强阻挡着一场雪崩。

Her massive breasts, now glistening with oil, rose and fell lazily. A bead of sweat rolled down her cleavage, navigating the valley like a slow river, disappearing into the knot of the bikini bottom.

她那宏伟的、此刻涂满精油的胸脯慵懒地起伏着。一滴汗珠顺着她的乳沟滚落，像一条缓慢的河流穿过山谷，消失在比基尼下装的绳结里。

Bang.

砰。

She raised a suppressed pistol and fired at a watermelon floating in the pool. The red fruit exploded, staining the blue water.

她举起一把装了消音器的手枪，对着漂浮在泳池里的西瓜开了一枪。红色的果肉炸开，染红了蓝色的水面。

"Missed the center by two centimeters," Chen Mo walked out onto the terrace, holding two iced caipirinhas. He was shirtless, wearing only linen shorts. His body had grown leaner and harder in the last six months.

“偏离中心两厘米，”陈默端着两杯加冰的卡琵莉亚鸡尾酒走到露台上。他赤裸着上身，只穿了一条亚麻短裤。这六个月来，他的身体变得更精瘦、更坚硬了。

"I'm bored, Chen," Miyetsuko threw the gun onto the table, the metal clattering against the glass. "Shooting fruit is boring. Shopping is boring. Even the view..." she gestured at the magnificent Sugarloaf Mountain, "...is starting to look like a postcard I've seen a thousand times."

“我很无聊，陈，”美悦子把枪扔在桌上，金属撞击玻璃发出脆响。“射击水果很无聊。购物很无聊。甚至这个景色……”她指了指壮丽的面包山，“……也开始像我看过一千遍的明信片了。”
