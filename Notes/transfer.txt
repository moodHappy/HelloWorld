Chapter 63: The Rotor and the Storm

第六十三章：旋翼与风暴

The roof door burst open. The wind hit them like a hammer.

屋顶的门被撞开。风像锤子一样砸在他们身上。

The roar of a helicopter drowned out everything. A sleek, black Eurocopter was hovering just above the pad, its rotors slicing the night air.

直升机的轰鸣声淹没了一切。一架流线型的黑色欧洲直升机正悬停在停机坪上方，旋翼切割着夜空。

"Kenji came through!" Chen Mo yelled.

“健二做到了！”陈默大喊。

They ran towards the chopper.

他们冲向直升机。

But suddenly, the door behind them exploded. Mishima stepped out, followed by four men with automatic rifles.

但突然，身后的门炸开了。三岛走了出来，身后跟着四个拿着自动步枪的人。

"You think you can just fly away?" Mishima shouted, his voice barely audible over the rotors.

“你以为你们能就这样飞走？”三岛大喊，声音在旋翼声中几乎听不见。

He aimed his pistol. Not at them. But at the helicopter pilot.

他举起手枪。不是瞄准他们。而是瞄准直升机飞行员。

If the pilot died, they were trapped on this roof.

如果飞行员死了，他们就被困在这个屋顶上了。

Miyetsuko saw it.

美悦子看到了。

She didn't run for cover. She turned around. The wind whipped the remnants of her red dress around her like a bloody flag.

她没有跑去寻找掩体。她转过身。风把她红裙的残片吹得像一面血腥的旗帜。

She walked towards Mishima. Slowly. Barefoot on the concrete.

她走向三岛。慢慢地。赤脚踩在混凝土上。

"Mishima!" she screamed. "You want a Queen? I'll give you a Queen's mercy!"

“三岛！”她尖叫。“你想要个王后？我就给你王后的仁慈！”

She raised her hand. She threw the Walther PPK at him.

她举起手。把那把沃尔特PPK扔向他。

Mishima flinched, instinctively dodging the flying gun.

三岛本能地瑟缩了一下，躲避飞来的枪。

That split second was enough.

那一瞬间就够了。

Chen Mo lunged forward, not to shoot, but to tackle Miyetsuko. He grabbed her waist and threw them both towards the open door of the hovering helicopter.

陈默向前猛扑，不是为了开枪，而是扑向美悦子。他抱住她的腰，把两人一起抛向悬停直升机敞开的舱门。

"Jump!"

“跳！”

They flew through the air.

他们在空中飞过。

Hands reached out from the cabin—Kenji's hired mercenaries pulled them in.

舱门里伸出几只手——健二雇佣的佣兵把他们拉了进去。

Rat-tat-tat-tat!

哒-哒-哒-哒！

Bullets sparked off the helicopter's skids.

子弹在直升机的起落架上擦出火花。

"Go! Go! Go!" Chen Mo slammed the door shut.

“走！走！走！”陈默猛地拉上舱门。

The helicopter banked sharply, diving off the edge of the building, plunging into the neon abyss of Tokyo before pulling up and accelerating away.

直升机猛烈倾斜，俯冲下楼顶边缘，扎进东京的霓虹深渊，然后拉起，加速离开。
