Chapter 24: The Anatomy of Power

第二十四章：权力的解剖

One hour later. The living room had transformed into a command center.

一小时后。客厅变成了一个指挥中心。

Chen Mo sat in front of his laptop, his fingers flying. Miyetsuko sat opposite him, wearing only one of Chen Mo's white shirts. The shirt was too big for her, but her chest filled it out to the bursting point, the buttons straining to hold on. Her bare legs were crossed on the table, toes wiggling playfully.

陈默坐在笔记本电脑前，手指飞舞。美悦子坐在他对面，身上只穿了一件陈默的白衬衫。衬衫对她来说太大了，但她的胸口却把布料撑到了爆裂的边缘，扣子岌岌可危。她光着的两条腿架在桌子上，脚趾调皮地晃动着。

"It's deciphered," Chen Mo hit the enter key. "You were right. It's a Death Note."

“解密完成了。”陈默敲下回车键。“你是对的。这是一本死亡笔记。”

The screen displayed a complex web of transactions.

屏幕上显示出一张复杂的交易网络图。

"Look at this." Chen Mo pointed to a node. "Minister of Defense, Tanaka. He received 500 million yen in 'consulting fees' via a shell company in the Cayman Islands three years ago. The timeline matches the approval of the Type-96 Tank procurement project."

“看这个。”陈默指着一个节点。“防卫省大臣，田中。三年前通过开曼群岛的空壳公司收了5亿日元‘咨询费’。时间线和96式坦克采购项目的批准时间完全吻合。”

"Tanaka..." Miyetsuko took a sip of coffee, her eyes narrowing. "That old fox is Kurosaki's biggest political umbrella. If Tanaka falls, Kurosaki loses his shield."

“田中……”美悦子喝了一口咖啡，眼睛眯了起来。“那只老狐狸是黑崎最大的政治保护伞。如果田中倒了，黑崎就失去了盾牌。”

"Do we leak it to the press?"

“我们要发给媒体吗？”

"No." Miyetsuko shook her head, her gaze sharp. "The press is controlled by them. If we release it, they will call it 'fake news' generated by AI. We need to be more precise."

“不。”美悦子摇摇头，目光锐利。“媒体在他们手里。如果我们发出去，他们会说是AI生成的‘假新闻’。我们要更精准。”

She stood up, walked behind Chen Mo, and bent down to look at the screen. The heavy softness of her chest pressed against Chen Mo's back again, a warm and distracting weight.

她站起来，走到陈默身后，俯身看屏幕。胸前沉甸甸的柔软再次压在陈默背上，那是温暖而令人分心的重量。

"Send a fragment of the data—specifically the record of the 500 million transfer—directly to Tanaka's private email. Subject line: 'Kurosaki says hello'."

“把数据的一个碎片——专门是那5亿转账记录——直接发给田中的私人邮箱。邮件标题写：‘黑崎向您问好’。”

"You want to frame Kurosaki?"

“你想嫁祸给黑崎？”

"I want to create paranoia. Tanaka will think Kurosaki is threatening him with the ledger. In panic, Tanaka will bite back. I want to watch the dogs eat each other."

“我要制造猜疑链。田中会以为黑崎在拿账本威胁他。在恐慌中，田中会反咬一口。我要看狗咬狗。”

"What about Kurosaki? What do we send him?"

“那黑崎呢？我们发给他什么？”

Miyetsuko smiled, a cruel, beautiful smile.

美悦子笑了，残酷而美丽。

"Send him a photo. Not of the data."

“发给他一张照片。不是数据的照片。”

"What photo?"

“什么照片？”

"A photo of us. From last night. The one I asked you to take."

“我们俩的照片。昨晚的那张。我让你拍的那张。”
