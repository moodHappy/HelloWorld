Here's a 100-word short story in English at CEFR Level B1, based on the theme "日常生活类" (Daily Life) in a 口语风格 (Conversational Style):

"My typical Sunday is so relaxing. I wake up late, around 10 am. After a quick breakfast, I head to the nearby park for a jog. The fresh air and scenic views always clear my mind. Later, I meet friends at a café for a chat. We gossip about our lives and share laughs. In the evening, I cook dinner at home and watch a movie. It's a simple, laid-back day. I feel recharged and ready for the week ahead. Sundays are my favorite – a perfect blend of exercise, socializing, and me-time."
