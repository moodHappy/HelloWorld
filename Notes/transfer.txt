So there I was, 2020, freshly divorced and completely wasted. In a drunken haze, I dumped my entire life savings into TSMC stock at 235.5. Driving home, I spotted my ex-wife checking into a motel with some dude. Long story short, he ended up in the hospital and I got a five-year vacation at the state's expense. Just got out this August, checked my account, and holy crapâ€”90 million bucks! I sat there staring at the screen, wondering if I should laugh at my ridiculous luck or cry about the five years I missed watching my money make more money than I ever could. Life's a joke, and apparently, I'm the punchline.
