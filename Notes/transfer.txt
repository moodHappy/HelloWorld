Chapter 4: The Aftertaste of Plum Wine

第四章：梅酒的后劲

The corridor lights were dim and warm, and each creak of the wooden floor pressed on Chen Mo’s tense nerves.

走廊里的灯光昏黄而暧昧，木地板的每一次“咯吱”声都踩在陈默紧绷的神经上。

“Come in for a while. The plum wine isn’t finished, and it would be a waste to throw it away,” Lin said softly when she stopped at the end of the corridor.

“进来坐坐吧，那瓶梅酒还没喝完，扔了怪可惜的。”走到走廊尽头时，林轻声说道。

There was no special reason, but on a night before heavy rain, refusing felt almost rude.

并没有什么特别的理由，但在暴雨将至的夜晚，拒绝显得像一种不解风情的失礼。

When the door closed, the sound of rain seemed to move far away, leaving only their quick breathing.

房门关上的一刻，外面的雨声仿佛被隔开，只剩两人略显急促的呼吸。

Tatami covered the floor, and the air carried the smell of straw and the faint scent from her skin.

房间铺着榻榻米，空气里有蔺草的气味，也有她身上淡淡的香。

She left only a small bedside lamp on, and the low light traced the full outline of her body under the plain robe.

她没有开大灯，只留一盏床头灯，昏暗的光线勾出浴衣下丰腴的轮廓。

She knelt by the low table and poured him a drink, and the loose collar shifted again as she leaned forward.

她跪坐在矮桌旁替他倒酒，前倾时宽松的领口再次轻轻晃动。

“Chen Mo,” she called his name, no longer teasing.

“陈默。”她忽然叫他的名字，不再带着戏谑。

“Yes?” His throat felt dry before he could drink.

“嗯？”他还没喝酒，喉咙却已经发紧。

“When a woman says she feels hot,” she said quietly, eyes bright, fingers resting on the knot at her waist, “she is not asking only for cool air.”

“你知道吗？当一个女人说她热的时候，”她低声说，指尖停在腰间的系带上，“她需要的不只是凉风。”

The soft sound of cloth sliding filled the silent room.

布料滑落的细响在寂静里显得格外清晰。
