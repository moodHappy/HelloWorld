Chapter 4: A Harbor in the Storm

第四章：风暴中的港湾

Part 1: The Escape

逃离

Miyetsuko didn't wait for her father's next words. She grabbed a thin coat and ran out of the study. The front door was heavy, but she pushed it open and stepped into the rain.

美悦子没等父亲再说下一句话。她抓起一件薄外套，冲出了书房。大门很重，但她推开了它，走进了雨中。

She didn't call for a driver. She walked to the main road and hailed a taxi. The driver looked at her wet dress in the rearview mirror but said nothing. She gave him the address of a small apartment building in Minato.

她没有叫司机，而是走到大路上拦了一辆出租车。司机从后视镜看着她湿透的礼服，什么也没说。她给了他一个位于港区的公寓地址。

She reached into her pocket and realized she only had a few bills. It was enough for the fare, but barely.

她摸了摸口袋，发现只有几张钞票。够付车费，但也仅此而已。

Part 2: The Door to Ayaka

向绫香求助

Sato Ayaka opened the door on the third ring. She was wearing a simple tracksuit, her hair tied in a messy bun. She stared at Miyetsuko, who was shivering and pale.

佐藤绫香在门铃响第三声时开了门。她穿着一件简单的运动服，头发扎成凌乱的发髻。她盯着浑身发抖、脸色苍白的美悦子，愣住了。

"Miyetsuko? What happened to you? The party isn't over yet, is it?" Ayaka asked, pulling her inside.

“美悦子？你怎么了？宴会还没结束吧？”绫香问道，把她拉进屋里。

The apartment was small and smelled of instant ramen. It was a world away from the Lin estate. Miyetsuko sat on the edge of a cheap fabric sofa, her wet dress dripping onto the floor.

公寓很小，弥漫着方便面的味道。这和林家大宅简直是两个世界。美悦子坐在廉价布艺沙发的边缘，湿透的礼服在地板上滴着水。

Part 3: The Confession

倾诉

"My father is going to sell me," Miyetsuko said. Her voice was flat, devoid of its usual high-class melody. "The company is failing. He signed a deal with the Kurosaki family."

“我父亲要把我卖了，”美悦子说道。她的声音很平，失去了往日那种高贵感。“公司要垮了。他和黑崎家签了协议。”

Ayaka handed her a warm towel. She sat cross-legged on the floor in front of her. "The Kurosakis? But they’re vultures. Everyone knows that. Can't your father find someone else?"

绫香递给她一条热毛巾，在美悦子面前的地板上盘腿坐下。“黑崎家？可他们是秃鹫啊，大家都知道。你父亲不能找别人吗？”

"There is no one else," Miyetsuko whispered. She clutched the towel tightly. "He said I’m the last thing he has left to trade. I felt like a piece of furniture being appraised."

“没有别人了，”美悦子低声说。她紧紧攥着毛巾。“他说我是他最后剩下的筹码。我觉得自己就像一件正在被估价的家具。”

Part 4: The Invisible Chain

无形的锁链

Ayaka reached out and touched the platinum necklace around Miyetsuko’s neck. The diamond caught the dim light of the apartment.

绫香伸手碰了碰美悦子颈间的铂金项链。钻石折射着公寓里昏暗的光。

"This is beautiful," Ayaka said, trying to lighten the mood. "Did he give this to you? Maybe he’s trying to make it up to you."

“这真漂亮，”绫香试图缓和气氛，“是他给你的吗？也许他是想补偿你。”

Miyetsuko touched the cold metal. She didn't tell Ayaka that it was a gift from Hasegawa Makoto, the man with the predatory eyes. She didn't know that every word she said was being recorded and sent to a black van three blocks away.

美悦子摸了摸冰冷的金属。她没告诉绫香这是长谷川诚送的礼物——那个眼神像掠食者一样的男人。她不知道，她说的每一个字正被记录下来，传送到三个街区外的一辆黑色厢式车里。

"I can't go back, Ayaka. I don't want to be a trophy," she said.

“我回不去了，绫香。我不想当个奖杯，”她说。

Ayaka looked at her friend with pity. She lived in a world of budgets and part-time jobs. She didn't understand the weight of a falling empire. "You can stay here tonight. But tomorrow... what will you do tomorrow?"

绫香怜悯地看着她的朋友。她生活在预算和兼职的世界里，无法理解一个帝国崩塌的重量。“你今晚可以住这儿。但明天……明天你打算怎么办？”
