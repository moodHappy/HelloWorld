The Man on the Bench

He had been sitting there since dawn, though no one would have guessed it.

他从黎明就坐在这里，但没人会注意到。

His coat was frayed at the cuffs, his shoes dusty, and the newspaper in his hands folded the same way every day.

他的外套袖口磨损，鞋子布满灰尘，手里的报纸每天都折叠成同样的样子。

He glanced up occasionally, watching the platform fill with passengers and empty again.

他偶尔抬头，看着站台上人来人往，又渐渐空了。

When the woman by the board muttered under her breath, he heard nothing—though if he had, he wouldn’t have cared.

当发车牌旁的女人低声自语时，他什么也没听见——即便听见，也不会在意。

He marked a line in the paper, tapped the edge of the bench, and let the clock move him forward rather than himself.

他在报纸上划了一行，敲了敲长椅边缘，让时间推动他前行，而不是自己。

The train arrived, shoving people into motion. He stayed, watching her hesitate before stepping on.

火车到站，人群被冲动挤得动了起来。他依旧坐着，看着她犹豫着上车。

When it pulled away, he returned to the page he had left open, though the words no longer seemed to matter.

火车驶离时，他又回到翻开的报纸上，但文字已不再重要。

The platform emptied, the morning sun touching the edge of the benches, and he remained.

站台空了，晨光落在长椅边缘，而他依旧坐着。

No one noticed, but he noticed everything: the coat too heavy, the reflection in the glass, the faint echo of footsteps.

无人留意，但他注意到一切：过重的外套，玻璃里的倒影，轻微的脚步声。

He folded the paper, adjusted his coat, and waited for the next day to begin its motion again.

他折好报纸，整理外套，静静等待新一天再次启动。
