好的，我给你写一个幽默带反转的英文版：

Ethan dashed into the store, eyes locked on the T-shirt he’d been dreaming about for weeks—the one with his favorite band’s logo. He grabbed it, heart racing.

“How much is this T-shirt?” he asked eagerly.

The clerk glanced at him and said, “Uh… sorry, that T-shirt’s been discontinued.”

Ethan froze. “Discontinued? But it’s right here!”

The clerk pointed behind him. Ethan turned—and saw a mannequin wearing the exact same T-shirt… with a “SOLD” tag stuck on it.

He blinked. Then laughed. “So… I’m paying for fashion déjà vu?”

“Exactly,” the clerk shrugged. “Better luck next time!”

Ethan shook his head, still laughing, thinking maybe the T-shirt was playing hard to get on purpose.
