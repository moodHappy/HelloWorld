The Museum of Stolen Moments housed intangible treasures. In the Hall of Childhood, a carousel spun silently, its painted horses forever mid-gallop. This was Elara's exhibit: the summer afternoon her father promised to take her, before the phone call stole him away. Visitors could smell phantom cotton candy and hear distant, vanished laughter. Elara visited often, tracing the worn brass pole of her favorite horse. She never rode it. Some moments, she knew, were too precious to relive, even here. They were perfect, stolen fragments, best preserved behind glass, untouched by the present.
