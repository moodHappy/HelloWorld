Chapter 68: The Umbrella Confrontation

第六十八章：伞下的对峙

As the crowd dispersed, Mishima walked up to her. His bodyguards flanked him, tense and ready.

人群散去时，三岛走向她。他的保镖护在两侧，紧绷着神经。

"A beautiful service, Mrs. Kurosaki," Mishima said, his voice low. "Or should I say... Mrs. Tanaka?"

“葬礼很美，黑崎夫人，”三岛低声说。“或者我该叫你……田中太太？”

"Miyetsuko is fine," she replied calmly. Chen Mo stepped slightly forward, placing himself between Mishima and her.

“叫美悦子就好，”她平静地回答。陈默稍微上前一步，挡在她和三岛之间。

"He died at a very... convenient time," Mishima looked at Chen Mo, then back at her. "Just as you returned. Just as the security system failed."

“他死得非常……及时，”三岛看了看陈默，又看回她。“就在你回来的时候。就在安保系统失效的时候。”

"Life is full of coincidences, Mishima-san," she lifted her veil.

“生活充满了巧合，三岛先生，”她掀起了面纱。

Her face was dry. Her makeup was perfect. Her lips were a shocking shade of red.

她的脸是干的。妆容完美。嘴唇涂着令人震惊的红色。

"And death... is full of opportunities."

“而死亡……充满了机遇。”

Mishima stepped closer. The rain drummed harder on the umbrellas.

三岛逼近一步。雨点更猛烈地敲打着伞面。

"You think you won because the old dog is dead? I am not Kurosaki. I don't want to break you. I want to erase you."

“你以为老狗死了你就赢了？我不是黑崎。我不想折磨你。我想抹除你。”

Miyetsuko laughed. A genuine, light laugh that echoed in the cemetery.

美悦子笑了。一声真诚、轻快的笑声在墓地回荡。

"Try it," she whispered. "But remember, I have the jungle in my blood now. And in the jungle... the predator doesn't roar before it bites."

“试试看，”她低语。“但记住，我的血里现在流淌着丛林。而在丛林里……掠食者咬人之前是不会吼叫的。”

She turned her back on him.

她背过身去。

"Let's go, Chen. The air here stinks of yesterday."

“走吧，陈。这儿的空气有一股昨天的臭味。”
