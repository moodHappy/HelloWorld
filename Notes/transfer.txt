Chapter 61: The Silencer in the Clutch

第六十一章：手包里的消音器

"You misunderstood one thing, Mishima." Miyetsuko's hand stopped inside her beaded clutch. Her voice was calm, almost bored.

“你误会了一件事，三岛。”美悦子的手停在珠绣手包里。她的声音平静，甚至带着一丝无聊。

"What's that?" Mishima frowned, sensing the danger in her stillness.

“什么？”三岛皱眉，感觉到了她静止中的危险。

"I didn't kill Kurosaki to find a new master. I killed him... to become the master."

“我杀黑崎不是为了找个新主人。我杀他……是为了成为主人。”

PFFT! PFFT!

噗！噗！

Two muffled shots.

两声闷响。

She didn't pull the gun out. She fired through the expensive clutch. The silk bag exploded in a cloud of beads and gunpowder smoke.

她没有把枪拔出来。她隔着昂贵的手包开了枪。丝绸包在珠子和火药烟雾中炸开。

The two bodyguards dropped instantly, clutching their kneecaps. They screamed, but the thick hotel carpet muffled the sound.

两个保镖瞬间倒下，捂着膝盖骨。他们惨叫，但厚重的酒店地毯吸收了声音。

Miyetsuko dropped the ruined bag, revealing a small, smoking customized Walther PPK in her hand. She pointed it straight at Mishima's forehead.

美悦子扔掉毁坏的包，露出手里一把冒着烟的小巧定制沃尔特PPK。她直指三岛的额头。

"Now, move. Or I'll give you a third eye."

“现在，滚开。否则我送你第三只眼。”

Mishima froze. He looked at the woman in the red dress—beautiful, elegant, and holding a gun like it was a flute. He raised his hands, smiling a twisted smile of genuine admiration.

三岛僵住了。他看着那个红裙女人——美丽、优雅，握枪的姿势像握着长笛。他举起双手，露出了一个真正赞赏的扭曲笑容。

"Bravo, Mrs. Kurosaki. Bravo."

“精彩，黑崎夫人。精彩。”
