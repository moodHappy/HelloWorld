Emergency Call

The phone rang at 2:17 a.m.

Not a ringtone—just a harsh vibration rattling on the nightstand.

Tom groaned and reached out, ready to silence it. Then he saw the screen.

Unknown Caller

He hesitated. No one good ever called at this hour.

“Hello?” His voice was thick with sleep.

For a moment, there was only breathing. Fast. Uneven.

“Tom?” a woman said. “Is this Tom Harris?”

“Yes. Who’s this?”

“I—I found your number on the fridge.” She swallowed hard. “Your mother collapsed.”

Tom sat up instantly. “What? Where are you?”

“At her apartment. She was making tea and just—fell. She’s breathing, but she won’t wake up. I already called an ambulance. They’re on the way.”

His heart slammed against his ribs. “I’m coming.”

He threw on jeans and a jacket, forgetting his shoes until he was already at the door. The streets were empty, traffic lights blinking uselessly at intersections. Every red light felt like an insult.

When he arrived, the ambulance lights painted the building in flashing blue and red. A neighbor stood outside, arms wrapped around herself.

“That’s my son,” she told the paramedic as Tom ran up, breathless.

Inside, his mother lay on the floor, oxygen mask on her face. Her eyes were closed, hair spread out like she’d just laid down for a nap.

“Mom?” he whispered.

She didn’t move.

At the hospital, time dissolved into plastic chairs and bad coffee. A doctor finally came out, mask pulled down around his neck.

“She had a mild stroke,” he said. “You called in time. She’ll be okay.”

Tom nodded, relief crashing over him so hard his knees almost gave out.

Later, sitting by her bed, his phone buzzed again.

Unknown Caller

He answered.

“It’s me,” the woman said softly. “I just wanted to check… is she alright?”

“Yes,” Tom said. “Thank you. You saved her.”

There was a pause. “I almost didn’t call,” she admitted. “I didn’t want to overstep.”

“I’m glad you did.”

He ended the call and looked at his mother, now sleeping peacefully.

The room was quiet again.

But this time, the silence felt earned.
