Video Call

The phone rang while she was washing a mug, soap still on her fingers.

她正在洗杯子，手上还沾着洗洁精，手机响了。

She wiped her hands on her jeans and looked at the screen.

她在牛仔裤上擦了擦手，看了一眼屏幕。

His name sat there, plain, like it had always been.

他的名字安静地躺在那里，和以前一样普通。

She answered without fixing her hair.

她接了电话，没有整理头发。

The camera opened on his face, too close, one eye slightly out of frame.

镜头一开，是他靠得太近的脸，一只眼睛被挤出了画面。

“Can you see me?” he asked.

“看得见吗？”他问。

“Too close,” she said.

“太近了。”她说。

He leaned back, the image steadied, and she saw the room behind him.

他往后靠了靠，画面稳定下来，她看见了他身后的房间。

A hotel lamp, yellow light, a bed that hadn’t been slept in yet.

一盏酒店的台灯，偏黄的光，一张还没被睡过的床。

“You’re not home,” she said.

“你不在家。”她说。

“Work,” he said. “Just one night.”

“出差。”他说，“就一晚。”

She nodded, though he hadn’t asked a question.

她点了点头，尽管他并没有问。

On her side, the kitchen light buzzed softly.

她这边，厨房的灯轻轻地嗡响着。

The window was open. Night air carried in traffic noise and cold.

窗户开着，夜风带着车声和凉意吹进来。

“You look tired,” he said.

“你看起来很累。”他说。

“I didn’t sleep much,” she said.

“没怎么睡。”她说。

He smiled in a way that suggested he knew why, though he couldn’t.

他笑了一下，好像他知道原因，其实并不知道。

For a second, neither of them spoke.

有那么一会儿，两个人都没说话。

The screen held them there, faces lit by different rooms.

屏幕把他们固定住了，脸被不同的房间照亮。

He adjusted the phone, and the camera dipped.

他动了动手机，镜头往下晃了一下。

She saw his collarbone, the open button at his neck.

她看见了他的锁骨，还有领口解开的那颗扣子。

“Careful,” she said.

“小心点。”她说。

“Sorry,” he said, not sounding sorry.

“抱歉。”他说，语气却不像。

She shifted the phone too.

她也调整了一下手机。

Now he could see more of her, the loose T-shirt, bare arms.

现在他能看见她更多一点，宽松的T恤，裸露的手臂。

He looked at the screen, then back at her eyes.

他先看了屏幕一眼，又回到她的眼睛。

“You’re at home,” he said.

“你在家。”他说。

“Yes,” she said.

“嗯。”她说。

“Alone?”

“一个人？”

She paused, just long enough to matter.

她停顿了一下，时间刚好足够让人注意到。

“Yes.”

“是。”

The silence came back, heavier this time.

沉默又回来了，这次更重。

She could hear his breathing through the speaker.

她能从扬声器里听到他的呼吸声。

Slow, controlled, like he was choosing it.

缓慢而克制，像是刻意的。

He leaned closer again.

他又凑近了一点。

“Turn the light a bit,” he said.

“把灯调一下。”他说。

“Why?” she asked.

“为什么？”她问。

“So I can see you.”

“这样我能看清你。”

She reached up and turned the lamp.

她伸手把灯转了一下。

The light slid across her face, caught her cheekbone, her mouth.

灯光掠过她的脸，停在她的颧骨和嘴角。

He didn’t speak.

他没说话。

She didn’t look away.

她也没有移开视线。

Outside, a car passed, headlights sweeping the wall.

窗外，一辆车开过，车灯扫过墙面。

“Are you still there?” she asked.

“你还在吗？”她问。

“Yes,” he said. “I’m here.”

“在。”他说，“我在。”

They stayed like that, watching each other breathe.

他们就那样待着，看着彼此呼吸。

No touching, no distance either.

没有触碰，也没有真正的距离。

Just a screen, warm faces, and a night that wasn’t finished yet.

只有一块屏幕，温热的脸，还有一个尚未结束的夜晚。
