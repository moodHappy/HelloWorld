# The Fortune Teller

Madam Zola claimed to predict the future with her crystal ball. "For just twenty bucks," she'd say, "I'll tell you what's gonna happen!"

One day, Bob came in looking for love advice. Madam Zola stared into her crystal ball and said, "I see... you're gonna meet someone tall, dark, and handsome."

Bob frowned. "But I'm Bob. I'm short, bald, and my last date was three years ago."

Madam Zola quickly added, "Oh, and I see you're gonna get a haircut! And a new personality!"

Bob sighed and handed her twenty bucks. "Worst fortune ever."

Madam Zola pocketed the cash. "Hey, I predicted you'd pay me, didn't I?"
