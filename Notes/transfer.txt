For six months, I've been in a relationship where my boyfriend always pays when we eat out. I posted about it online, and immediately someone called me a "fool who doesn't listen to advice." Another commenter asked, "Does your girlfriend pay for everything?!" I clarified, "I'm a girl, sis." The original criticizer replied, "Then it's fine, then it's fine." I smiled at their assumptions. My boyfriend actually insists on treating me, saying he enjoys taking care of me. We've discussed splitting bills, but for now, this arrangement makes us both happy. Love isn't about keeping score.
