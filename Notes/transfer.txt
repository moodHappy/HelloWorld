Chapter 64: The Rat in the Maze

第六十四章：迷宫里的老鼠

Tokyo Detention House.

东京拘留所。

Click.

咔哒。

The heavy steel door of Cell 402 unlatched. It swung open an inch.

402号牢房厚重的钢门解锁了。它弹开了一英寸。

Kurosaki's heart hammered against his ribs. It was true. The Loyalists were real.

黑崎的心脏猛烈撞击着肋骨。是真的。死忠派是真的。

He peeked into the corridor. Empty.

他偷看走廊。空的。

He slipped out. He was wearing his grey prison uniform, socks on the cold linoleum.

他溜了出去。穿着灰色的囚服，袜子踩在冰冷的地板革上。

"Corridor B," he muttered, running towards the junction. "Service elevator."

“B走廊，”他喃喃自语，跑向交叉口。“服务电梯。”

He felt a surge of adrenaline he hadn't felt in years. He was escaping. He would go to Rio. He would rebuild. He would kill Miyetsuko.

他感觉到一股多年未有的肾上腺素激增。他在越狱。他要去里约。他要重建帝国。他要杀了美悦子。

He reached the end of the corridor. He turned the corner.

他跑到了走廊尽头。转过拐角。

WHEEP-WHEEP-WHEEP!

呜-呜-呜！

Red lights flashed instantly. A siren wailed, deafening in the confined space.

红灯瞬间闪烁。警报凄厉地响起，在封闭空间里震耳欲聋。

"Prisoner escape! Sector 4!" The automated voice boomed.

“囚犯越狱！第四区！”自动语音轰鸣。

Kurosaki froze. "No... the loop... they said the camera loop..."

黑崎僵住了。“不……循环……他们说摄像头循环……”

At the other end of the hallway, a heavy blast door slammed shut, blocking his path to the elevator.

在走廊另一头，一道厚重的防爆门砰地关上，堵死了通往电梯的路。

Behind him, heavy boots thundered.

在他身后，沉重的靴声雷动。

"Freeze! Get on the ground!"

“不许动！趴在地上！”

Three guards turned the corner. They weren't holding tasers. They were holding assault rifles. And they weren't the usual night shift guards. They were Mishima's private contractors in uniform.

三个警卫转过拐角。他们拿的不是电击枪。是突击步枪。而且他们不是通常的夜班警卫。他们是穿着制服的三岛私人承包商。

Kurosaki raised his hands. "Wait! I am Kurosaki Soichiro! I have money! I can pay..."

黑崎举起手。“等等！我是黑崎宗一郎！我有钱！我可以付……”

The lead guard smiled under his visor.

领头的警卫在面罩下笑了。

"Mishima-san says goodbye."

“三岛先生说再见。”

RAT-TAT-TAT.

哒-哒-哒。

In the monitor at the Aman hotel, Miyetsuko watched the grey pixelated figure jerk violently as bullets tore through him. He slumped against the wall, sliding down leaving a digital smear of black blood.

在安缦酒店的显示器里，美悦子看着那个灰色的像素人影在子弹穿透时剧烈抽搐。他瘫倒在墙上，滑落下去，留下一道黑色的数码血痕。
