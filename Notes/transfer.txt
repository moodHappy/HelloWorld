Chapter 5: The Heavy Silence at Dinner

第五章：晚餐时的沉重

Miyetsuko sat at the small dining table, the steam from the grilled mackerel rising to meet her face. She had changed into a simple oversized t-shirt, her damp hair tucked behind her ears, successfully hiding any trace of the afternoon’s chaos. Opposite her, her father stared blankly at his bowl, his chopsticks barely moving. The usual lighthearted chatter was replaced by a suffocating tension. Her mother sighed, a sound so heavy it seemed to sink into the floorboards. "The supplier raised prices again," she murmured, breaking the silence. "At this rate, the shop won't last through the summer."

美悦子坐在小餐桌旁，烤鲭鱼的蒸汽扑面而来。她换上了一件简单的宽松T恤，湿漉漉的头发扎在耳后，成功掩盖了下午那场混乱的所有痕迹。父亲坐在她对面，盯着碗发呆，筷子几乎没动。往常轻松的闲聊被一种窒息的紧张感所取代。母亲叹了口气，那声音沉重得仿佛要陷进地板里。“供应商又涨价了，”她低声打破沉默，“照这个速度下去，店里撑不过这个夏天。”

Her father finally looked up, his eyes bloodshot and weary. "It's not just the suppliers. Foot traffic is down, and the big chains are squeezing us out," he said, his voice sounding older than she remembered. He took a slow, deliberate sip of his miso soup, but it clearly brought him no comfort. "I might have to take out another loan, but the interest rates are punishing." Miyetsuko kept her head down, picking at a piece of fish. She felt a sudden, sharp pang of guilt. While her parents were drowning in the cold reality of financial ruin, she had been pinned against a bathroom wall, lost in a world of raw, selfish pleasure.

父亲终于抬起头，双眼布满血丝，透着疲惫。“不只是供应商的问题。客流量在减少，连锁大店也在排挤我们，”他的声音听起来比记忆中要苍老许多。他缓慢而慎重地抿了一口味增汤，但这显然没能给他带来任何安慰。“我可能得再贷一笔款，但利息简直是在杀人。”美悦子低着头，拨弄着一块鱼肉。她突然感到一阵尖锐的愧疚。当父母正沉溺在生计破产的残酷现实中时，她却被按在厕所墙上，沉沦在原始而自私的欲望里。

"Don't worry about us, Miyetsuko," her mother said, forcing a faint, trembling smile. "Just focus on your entrance exams. We'll find a way." She reached across the table to pat Miyetsuko’s hand, but Miyetsuko instinctively flinched. Her skin still felt hypersensitive, her mind still flashing back to that photo on her phone upstairs. The contrast was too much—the grim reality of her family’s struggle and the secret, dirty thrill she shared with Shiraishi. She nodded silently, unable to look her mother in the eye, the taste of the fish turning to ash in her mouth.

“别担心我们，美悦子，”母亲强撑出一个微弱且颤抖的微笑，“你只管专心准备升学考试，我们会想办法的。”她伸手过桌想拍拍美悦子的手，美悦子却本能地瑟缩了一下。她的皮肤依然感觉异常敏感，脑海中不断闪回楼上手机里的那张照片。反差实在太大了——一边是家庭挣扎的严峻现实，另一边则是她和白石共享的、隐秘而肮脏的刺激。她沉默地低着头，不敢直视母亲的眼睛，嘴里的鱼肉味变得如同嚼蜡。
