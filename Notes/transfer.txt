Ten days ago, I spotted two pairs of gorgeous size 43 shoes. Did a quick toe-wiggle in the store and thought, "Perfect!" Fast forward to actually wearing them... OMG, my feet were screaming bloody murder! Turns out they were squeezing my toes like vise grips. Today, I hobbled back to the mall, looking like a penguin with a foot cramp. The sales assistant tried not to laugh as I admitted my "brilliant" purchase. "Same size?" she asked. "Bigger!" I groaned. Now I'm the proud owner of two new pairsâ€”properly tried on this time. Lesson learned: never trust a 2-second shoe test!
