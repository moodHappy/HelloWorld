As a defense attorney, I try to keep a straight face in court. But today? Almost impossible. Both sides submitted the same audio evidence. The judge played it, and the recording began with my client saying, "Let's agree neither of us will record this, okay?" Then the opposing party's voice: "No problem."

I had to bite my cheek so hard I tasted blood. The judge paused, looking just as amused. My client leaned over and whispered, "Is it bad that I recorded that?" I just shook my head. Some days, this job is just too ridiculous. And I absolutely cannot laugh.
