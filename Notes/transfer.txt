Maya invented stories about her childhood to impress her new friends. Each lie was carefully woven, creating an intricate tapestry of false memories. But as her tales grew more elaborate, she found herself lost in her own deception. One evening, while describing her "heroic father," she suddenly remembered the real manâ€”flawed but loving, struggling yet present. The lies had unraveled something genuine. In trying to escape her ordinary past, Maya had rediscovered its quiet value. Sometimes, she realized, the truth only emerges when we wrap it in lies, waiting for the moment when the falsehoods fall away.
