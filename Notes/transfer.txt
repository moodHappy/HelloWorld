I washed my car myself today, carefully scrubbing every inch until it sparkled. "Fifteen yuan saved," I thought proudly, admiring my handiwork. Feeling quite satisfied with my frugality, I sat down and opened my stock app. My smile quickly faded as I stared at the screen in disbelief. The numbers were bleeding red, and my portfolio value had plummeted dramatically. In just a few hours, I had lost thousands â€“ enough to buy several cars. I glanced back at my freshly washed car and sighed. Sometimes, saving a little feels meaningless when you've lost a lot.
