# Going Through Customs

John approached the customs officer with a nervous smile. "Anything to declare?" asked the stern-faced officer.

"Just this," John said, pulling out a giant rubber chicken from his suitcase.

The officer raised an eyebrow. "And what is the purpose of this item, sir?"

"It's a emotional support chicken," John replied seriously. "I get anxious without him."

The officer stared for a moment, then burst out laughing. "Welcome to the country," he said, stamping John's passport. "But next time, maybe just get a regular therapy dog."

John nodded, tucking his rubber chicken under his arm. "Would you believe I also have a comfort rubber duck?"
