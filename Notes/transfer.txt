The Evergreen Library stood untouched by time. When Sarah entered, the grandfather clock froze its pendulum. Dust particles hung motionless in sunbeams. Patients sat with books suspended mid-page-turn, their expressions caught between curiosity and wonder.

Sarah realized she could move freely in this temporal sanctuary. She wandered through aisles of infinite knowledge, unbound by deadlines or schedules. Books whispered their secrets as she passed, promising endless discovery.

In this place, time wasn't stolen but preservedâ€”a library where every moment lasted forever, and every reader could linger as long as they desired between the pages of eternity.
