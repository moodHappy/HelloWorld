Chapter 2: The Jungle Sanctuary

第二集：丛林避难所

Rain drummed against the canopy above, thick and relentless. The humid scent of wet earth mixed with gunpowder and smoke from distant explosions. Miyetsuko crouched behind a toppled crate, silk robe damp and clinging, hair plastered to her skin. Chen Mo moved silently beside her, eyes scanning the treeline, weapon ready.

雨水敲击在头顶的林冠上，密集而无情。湿土的闷味与远处爆炸的火药烟雾交织。美悦子蹲在倒下的木箱后，丝绸睡袍湿透贴身，发丝粘在肌肤上。陈默默默移动在她身旁，眼睛扫视林边，武器随时就绪。

“Forklift route is clear,” Chen Mo whispered, voice barely audible over the rain. “We move now, or they’ll tighten the net.”

“叉车路线畅通，”陈默低语，声音在雨声中几乎听不见。“现在走，否则他们会收紧包围。”

Miyetsuko’s lips curved. “Perfect.” She pressed close to him, letting the heat of her body seep into his side. “I like it when danger tastes… like anticipation.” Her hand brushed the back of his neck, teasing, testing.

美悦子唇角微翘。“完美。”她靠近他，让身体的热量渗入他的侧身。“我喜欢危险带来的味道……像期待一样。”她的手轻触他的颈背，挑逗，试探。

The forklift groaned to life. Chen Mo jumped into the driver’s seat, engine growling beneath his hands. Miyetsuko slid in beside him, robe still clinging, fingers tracing the edges of his tactical vest in a touch that was both intimate and commanding.

叉车低沉地启动。陈默跳进驾驶座，手下引擎发出低沉咆哮。美悦子滑进他旁边，睡袍湿贴身，手指沿着他的战术背心边缘轻触，既亲密又带有支配意味。

They barreled through the warehouse, pallets toppling, crates smashing, bullets ricocheting off metal. Rain soaked the concrete floor, mixing with blood from a mercenary who had misjudged his shot. Miyetsuko laughed softly, a sound like silk tearing.

他们冲过仓库，托盘倾倒，木箱破裂，子弹在金属间反弹。雨水浸湿混凝土地面，混合着一名误判射击的雇佣兵的鲜血。美悦子轻笑，声音如丝绸撕裂。

Once outside, the city lights blurred into streaks as they drove into the jungle. The air grew thick with humidity, the scent of earth and leaves masking gunpowder. Miyetsuko finally exhaled, pressing against Chen Mo’s shoulder. “I needed that,” she whispered, her lips brushing his ear. “The chaos… it reminds me I’m alive.”

出了仓库，城市灯光在他们驶入丛林时化作光的条纹。空气湿重，泥土与树叶的味道掩盖了火药味。美悦子终于呼出一口气，靠在陈默肩膀上。“我需要这样的感觉，”她低语，嘴唇贴近他的耳朵。“混乱……提醒我，我还活着。”

In the bunker, dimly lit, Miyetsuko allowed herself to sink onto the cot. Chen Mo crouched beside her, lifting her robe slightly to inspect bruises along her ribs. His fingers traced them lightly, precise, deliberate—part care, part ritual.

在昏暗的地堡中，美悦子允许自己坐在床铺上。陈默蹲在旁边，微微掀起她的睡袍检查肋骨上的淤青。指尖轻轻滑过，精准而有意——部分是关怀，部分是仪式感。

“I… hate that night,” she murmured, voice barely audible. “White kimono… his hands… my father…” Her fingers clenched into his vest. “But you… you make it bearable.”

“我……恨那个夜晚，”她低语，声音几乎听不见。“白无垢……他的手……我的父亲……”她的手紧握他的背心。“但你……你让这一切可以承受。”

Chen Mo’s lips brushed her temple, warm against cold skin. “I bring you back,” he said. “Every time. Every scar, every memory… I anchor you here.” His hand slid along her thigh, lightly, teasing, asserting.

陈默的唇轻触她的太阳穴，温暖抵在冰冷肌肤上。“我把你拉回来，”他说。“每一次。每一条伤疤，每一段记忆……我让你停留在这里。”他的手滑过她的大腿，轻柔、挑逗、带着支配意味。

Miyetsuko leaned into him, letting her head rest against his chest. “And when the world comes for us… I want them to remember us,” she whispered, “not as prey, but as the storm.” Her hand traced the line of his jaw, nails grazing lightly. “We are the storm, Chen Mo.”

美悦子靠向他，头贴在他胸口。“当世界来找我们时……我要他们记住我们，”她低语，“不是猎物，而是风暴。”她的手沿着下颌滑过，指甲轻轻掠过。“我们就是风暴，陈默。”

Outside, the jungle waited. Rain slicked leaves, hidden threats, distant gunfire—but inside the bunker, blood, desire, and strategy intertwined. They were alive. They were together. And the storm was coming.

窗外，丛林静待。雨打湿叶片，潜伏的威胁，远处的枪声——但在地堡内，鲜血、欲望与策略交织。他们活着。他们在一起。风暴即将来临。
