Growing up poor meant treats were rare. So when my wealthy aunt showed up with a fancy box of Nescaf√©, my parents practically worshiped it. "This must be expensive health food!" they whispered. For months, they saved it like liquid gold, making me a cup every night before bed. I'd gulp it down while they watched proudly, thinking they were giving me superpowers. Meanwhile, I was just getting a nightly caffeine rush that had me doing backflips in my pajamas while they thought I was simply thriving from their "nutritious" gift. If only they knew I was basically drinking dessert for dinner!
