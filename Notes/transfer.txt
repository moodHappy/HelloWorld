Hey everyone! I'm Mike, just transferred to this school. Um, so yeah... I'm kinda nervous meeting all of you! I love hiking and playing guitar in my free time. My mom says I talk too much when I'm excited, sorry in advance! What about you guys? Oh wait, I forgot to ask - do you like pizza? Because I know this amazing place downtown... Anyway, it's cool to meet you all! Let's hang out sometime? Maybe we could study together or something? Yeah, looking forward to getting to know you all better!
