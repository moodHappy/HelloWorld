The Light Across the Alley

Every night at 10:47, the light came on.

Mark noticed it by accident at first—standing in his kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil, staring out at the narrow alley between buildings. One window across from his apartment would glow warm yellow, perfectly framed like a stage.

A woman lived there.
He didn’t know her name. He didn’t need to.

She moved slowly, deliberately. Sometimes she read by the window. Sometimes she talked on the phone, pacing. Once, she laughed so suddenly that Mark almost spilled hot water on his hand.

He told himself it was harmless. He wasn’t doing anything. Just looking.

Soon, his evenings adjusted themselves around that window. He washed dishes later. He made tea twice. If the light didn’t come on, he felt oddly disappointed, like a show had been canceled without notice.

One night, the woman stood at the window and looked straight at him.

Mark froze.

The alley was dark. His kitchen light was off. There was no way she could see him—or so he thought. Still, his heart raced. He stepped back, ashamed, annoyed with himself.

The next evening, the light came on again.
So did Mark’s curiosity.

This time, a note appeared on the glass, written in thick black marker.

“You’re usually watching by now.”

His stomach dropped.

He didn’t sleep that night.

The following evening, the note was gone. The woman sat calmly, sipping something from a mug, eyes occasionally drifting toward his window. Not accusing. Not angry.

Expectant.

Mark closed his curtains.

Minutes passed. Ten. Twenty.

His phone buzzed. An unknown number.

> You don’t have to hide, the message read.
I noticed you weeks ago.



His fingers hovered over the screen.

> Why didn’t you stop me? he typed.



The reply came almost instantly.

> Because you never crossed the line.
You looked, but you didn’t intrude.



The next night, Mark didn’t watch.

Instead, he walked down into the alley and stood beneath her window. The light was on. The glass was open.

She looked down and smiled.

“Funny,” she said, “how close things feel from far away.”

Mark nodded.
“Funny how different it feels when you’re seen.”

The light stayed on long after that.

But the window was never just a window again.
