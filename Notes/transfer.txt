Chapter 1: The Cold Altar of Tokyo

第一章：东京的冷冽祭坛

Aman Tokyo. The Corner Suite. Midnight.

东京安缦。角房套房。午夜。

The skyline of Tokyo bled neon through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Below, the city was a sprawling circuit board of millions of lives, all blissfully unaware of the two predators nesting in the dark above them.

落地窗外，东京的天际线渗出霓虹的血色。下方，这座城市是一块由数百万生命组成的巨大电路板，所有人都幸福地对头顶黑暗中筑巢的两头掠食者一无所知。

Miyetsuko stood by the glass, her reflection a ghost of silk and lethal grace. She wore a midnight-blue silk robe that slid over her skin like cool water. In her hand, she swirled a glass of vintage Hibiki, the ice clicking like a countdown.

美悦子站在窗前，她的倒影是一抹由丝绸与致命优雅组成的幽灵。她穿着一件午夜蓝的丝绸睡袍，绸缎像凉水般滑过肌肤。她轻轻摇晃着手中的陈年响牌威士忌，冰块撞击声如倒计时般清脆。

"The security logs from Fuchu Prison are updated," Chen Mo’s voice floated from the shadows.

“府中监狱的安保日志更新了，”陈默的声音从阴影中飘来。

He sat at a low table, his face illuminated by the cold blue glow of three holographic screens. Lines of green code cascaded down his glasses, reflecting the blueprint of a fortress.

他坐在矮桌旁，三块全息屏幕的冷蓝光映照着他的脸。绿色的代码流顺着他的镜片倾泻而下，折射出一座堡垒的蓝图。

"Mishima’s money is flowing into the pockets of the guards. He thinks he’s building a wall to keep Kurosaki in. He doesn't realize he's just building a coffin for himself."

“三岛的钱正流进警卫的口袋。他以为自己在筑墙困住黑崎。他没意识到，他只是在给自己造棺材。”

Miyetsuko turned. The high slit of her robe parted, revealing her long, pale thigh. There, strapped against her skin with a lace garter, sat the Golden Derringer. It caught the moonlight, a beautiful, gilded promise of death.

美悦子转身。睡袍的高开叉散开，露出修长苍白的大腿。在那儿，用蕾丝枪带缚在皮肤上的，正是那把金色德林加。它捕捉着月光，是一份华丽、镀金的死亡诺言。

"Mishima is getting greedy, Chen," she murmured, walking toward him. Her bare feet made no sound on the stone floor. "He looked at me today at the funeral. He didn't see a creditor. He saw a 'widow' he could collect. He wants to be the new owner of the Kurosaki throne. And he wants me as the crown jewel."

“三岛变得贪婪了，陈，”她呢喃着走向他。赤脚踩在石质地板上悄无声息。“他在今天的葬礼上盯着我看。他看到的不是债权人，而是一个可以回收的‘遗孀’。他想成为黑崎王座的新主人，而他想要我成为那颗皇冠上的明珠。”

She stopped behind Chen Mo, resting her hands on his shoulders. Her scent—jasmine and gunpowder—enveloped him.

她在陈默身后停下，双手搭在他的肩头。她的气息——茉莉花与火药味——笼罩了他。

"He doesn't know the Law," she whispered into his ear, her lips brushing the shell of his ear. "Whoever tries to own the Widow... pays with his blood."

“他不知道那条法则，”她贴着他的耳朵低语，嘴唇擦过他的耳廓。“凡试图占有寡妇者……必以鲜血偿还。”

Chen Mo didn't look away from the screens, but his hand reached up, covering hers. His grip was firm, grounding.

陈默没有移开视线，但他伸手覆住了她的手。他的抓握很有力，让她感到踏实。

"The 'Trojan Horse' plan is ready," Chen Mo said, his fingers tapping the keys. "We will feed Mishima the information he wants. He will think he’s rescuing Kurosaki to use him as a puppet. But he's actually walking into our theater."

“‘特洛伊木马’计划准备就绪，”陈默说着，手指敲击键盘。“我们会喂给三岛他想要的信息。他会以为自己在营救黑崎，想把他当傀儡。但实际上，他是在走进我们的剧场。”

Miyetsuko leaned down, her heavy breasts pressing against his back through the silk. She watched the hologram of the prison corridors.

美悦子俯下身，沉甸甸的胸部隔着丝绸紧贴他的后背。她注视着监狱走廊的全息图。

"I want the execution to be poetic, Chen. I want Kurosaki to see me in the white kimono again. One last time. Before I burn the memory out of his eyes."

“我要这场处决富有诗意，陈。我要让黑崎再次见到穿白无垢的我。最后一次。然后我再从他的眼睛里烧掉那段记忆。”

"You'll have it," Chen Mo turned his head, looking at her with an intensity that would have withered anyone else. "Everything you want. I'll burn this city down if it helps you sleep without nightmares."

“你会如愿以偿，”陈默转过头，用一种足以让任何人枯萎的强烈眼神看着她。“所有你想要的。如果能让你不再做噩梦，我会烧了这座城市。”

Miyetsuko smiled—the dangerous, seductive smile of the Black Widow. She took the Golden Derringer from her thigh and traced the cold barrel along Chen Mo’s jawline. It wasn't a threat; it was a caress.

美悦子笑了——那是黑寡妇危险且诱人的笑。她从大腿上取下那把金色德林加，用冰冷的枪管沿着陈默的下颚线划过。这不是威胁，而是爱抚。

"The only man I can't kill," she whispered, her voice dripping with dark affection. "My Knight. My Brain. My only exception."

“我唯一杀不掉的男人，”她低声呢喃，声音里滴落着黑暗的柔情。“我的骑士。我的大脑。我唯一的豁免。”

She leaned in, kissing him deeply, the taste of whiskey and cold metal between them. Outside, the lights of Tokyo flickered, unaware that the Queen had returned, and the hunt had begun.

她俯身深吻他，两人的唇齿间萦绕着威士忌与冰冷金属的味道。窗外，东京的灯火闪烁，并不知道女王已经归来，而狩猎已经开始。
