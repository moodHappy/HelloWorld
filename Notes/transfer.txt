# Love at the Supermarket

Tom was very nervous for his date with Lisa. He bought flowers, chocolates, and even practiced his smile in the mirror. At the supermarket, he carefully picked a perfect red rose. As he reached for his wallet, he realized he had forgotten it! His face turned red. Lisa arrived just then and saw him. "Forgot your money?" she laughed. "I was going to pay anyway," she said. Tom felt embarrassed but relieved. They had coffee together, and Tom realized that love isn't about perfect roses, but about being able to laugh at yourself. Lisa thought his red face was actually quite cute.
