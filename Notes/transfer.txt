Title: Heavy Floods Hit Southeast Asia

Heavy rains and floods have affected many countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. In Indonesia, the death toll from floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra has risen to 442. Many roads are closed, and internet and electricity are only partially available. The situation is similar in Thailand, where 170 people have died, and in Malaysia, where two people have died. 

The floods were caused by strong storms and heavy rains. A rare tropical storm called Cyclone Senyar hit Indonesia, causing landslides and flooding. Many people have lost their homes, and thousands of buildings are underwater. In Thailand, the city of Hat Yai experienced very heavy rainfall, and the death toll is rising. 

In Sri Lanka, at least 193 people have died due to Cyclone Ditwah, and many more are missing. The government has declared a state of emergency, and many people are without electricity or running water. The extreme weather in Southeast Asia may be caused by the combination of a typhoon and a rare cyclone. Climate change is making storms more frequent and intense, leading to heavier rainfall and stronger winds.
