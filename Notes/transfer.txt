# The Marriage/Family Circus

Tom's wife asked him to baby-sit while she ran errands. "How hard can it be?" he thought. Three hours later, the living room looked like a tornado hit a toy store, their daughter had turned the cat into a hat, and their son was using the dog as a steed for his action figures. When his wife returned, Tom said proudly, "They're all alive!" She sighed, "Next time, maybe just focus on keeping them vertical." Welcome to the greatest show on Earth: marriage and family, where every day is a new adventure and the only guaranteed thing is that someone will need a bath.
