Chapter 63: The Conductor of Shadows

第六十三章：影子的指挥家

Aman Tokyo. The Suite.

东京安缦。套房。

It was 02:55 AM.

凌晨02:55。

Chen Mo sat in front of a bank of monitors. The blue light illuminated his face. On the screen was the live feed from the Tokyo Detention House.

陈默坐在一排显示器前。蓝光照亮了他的脸。屏幕上是东京拘留所的实时画面。

Miyetsuko stood behind him, wearing a silk robe, a glass of wine in her hand.

美悦子站在他身后，穿着丝绸睡袍，手里端着一杯红酒。

"Is he awake?" she asked.

“他醒了吗？”她问。

"He's pacing," Chen Mo pointed to Cell 402. "Heart rate 140. He's terrified."

“他在踱步，”陈默指着402号牢房。“心率140。他吓坏了。”

"Good," she took a sip. "Fear makes you stupid."

“很好，”她抿了一口。“恐惧让人变蠢。”

Chen Mo's fingers flew across the keyboard.

陈默的手指在键盘上飞舞。

"Bypassing the subnet. Injecting the loop on Corridor B cameras... Done. Disabling the silent alarm on Cell 402... Done."

“绕过子网。注入B走廊摄像头循环……完成。禁用402号牢房静音警报……完成。”

He paused, his finger hovering over the 'Enter' key.

他停顿了一下，手指悬在“回车”键上。

"At 03:00, I open his door. But I'm not opening the elevator. And I'm not freezing the motion detectors in the hallway."

“03:00，我打开他的门。但我不会打开电梯。我也不会冻结走廊的运动探测器。”

"So?"

“所以？”

"So when he steps out, the alarms will scream. And the guards—Mishima's guards—will see an escaping prisoner."

“所以当他踏出那一步，警报会尖叫。而警卫——三岛的警卫——会看到一个正在越狱的囚犯。”

Miyetsuko leaned over his shoulder. She watched the digital clock ticking down.

美悦子从他肩头探过身。看着数字时钟倒数。

02:58... 02:59...

02:58……02:59……

"Do it," she whispered. "Open the cage."

“动手，”她低语。“打开笼子。”
