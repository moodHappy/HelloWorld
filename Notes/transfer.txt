Customer: "Hey, I got a few questions for ya."
Tattoo artist: "Shoot."
Customer: "First off, can you do animated tats? Like, maybe a GIF of a dancing cat?"
The tattoo artist paused, needle in mid-air. "Dude, that's not how ink works."
"Oh. Well, can you at least make it look like it's moving when I flex?"
"Only if you want it to look like a blob when you're not flexing."
"Hmm. What about a QR code that links to the GIF?"
The artist sighed. "Just tell me when you want a regular tattoo."
