Front Desk

Elaine had learned how to smile without meaning it.

Her shift started at three in the afternoon, when the hotel lobby was at its quietest. Check-outs were done, check-ins not yet begun. The carpet still held the warmth of the morning sun. She wiped the counter even when it was already clean.

Most guests never looked at her face. They looked at the screen, the key cards, the clock on the wall behind her. When they did look up, it was usually to complain.

“The room is too cold.” “The Wi-Fi is slow.” “I asked for a higher floor.”

She nodded, typed, apologized. The words came out automatically.

Elaine had been working here for seven years. Long enough to know which guests would be trouble the moment they walked in. Long enough to recognize loneliness by the way someone hesitated before asking a question.

At 6:40 p.m., a man checked in alone. Mid-forties, neat clothes, tired eyes. He slid his ID across the counter and waited without saying anything.

She handed him his key. “Room 614. Elevator on your left.”

“Thanks,” he said quietly.

That was all.

After he left, the lobby filled again. A family arguing over luggage. A couple whispering too close to each other. A businessman pacing while shouting into his phone.

At 9:15, Elaine took her break. She sat in the staff room with a vending machine sandwich and scrolled through her phone. No new messages. She didn’t expect any.

She used to imagine leaving—another city, another job. But years passed quickly when every day looked the same. The hotel didn’t change. Neither did she.

Near midnight, a guest came down to complain about noise. Elaine apologized, made a call upstairs, wrote a note she knew no one would read.

When her shift ended, she put on her coat and stepped outside. The parking lot was nearly empty. Cold air bit her face, sharp and real.

For a moment, she stood there, keys in hand, not moving.

Tomorrow, she would come back. Stand behind the counter. Smile again.

But tonight, at least, the quiet belonged to her.
