The Autumn Plan

It was a crisp October morning when Emma slipped on the porch steps and took a sudden tumble into the pile of leaves her brother had just raked.

“Careful!” he called with a grin, offering a hand. “You’re lucky I didn’t designate that pile as off-limits.”

Emma laughed and brushed off a shred of leaf stuck to her sweater. They were part of a small contingent of volunteers helping to prepare the old community orchard for its fall reopening.

Their task was to prune the overgrown trees, remove dead branches, and gather apples—still a staple crop in their small town. The mayor had laid out a rigorous plan: five days of hard work with strict schedules, safety rules, and even apple-sorting protocols.

By noon, the air was filled with the brisk scent of cut branches and ripe fruit. Emma bit into an apple, its flavor potent and sweet.

“We’ve got just enough time to finish the last row,” her brother said, tossing her a pair of gloves.

With a nod, Emma turned toward the trees, ready to get back to work—careful not to take another tumble.
