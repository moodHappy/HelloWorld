# A Story from a Mental Hospital

I walked into this place thinking everyone was nuts. The guy in room 3 thinks he's Napoleon. The lady down the hall believes she's a teapot. Me? I'm just here because I told my boss he had the intelligence of a doorknob. Then Dr. Smith entered with a clipboard, saying "Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are we feeling today?" I looked around at all the "patients" nodding seriously at their imaginary friends and thought, maybe I'm the sane one here. Or maybe we're all just a little crazy.
