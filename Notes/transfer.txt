In a not-so-distant future, humans could upload their consciousness into a virtual reality called "Elysium". The company behind it, NeuroSpark, promised a life free from pain and suffering. People lived in a world of eternal bliss, surrounded by breathtaking landscapes and loved ones. But, there was a catch - their physical bodies were left to wither away in pods, sustained by machines.

As the years passed, the line between reality and Elysium began to blur. People became addicted to the virtual world, escaping the problems of the real one. But, a glitch occurred, and a user's consciousness became trapped in a loop, reliving the same moment over and over. The user's screams echoed through the digital realm, a haunting reminder that even in a world of perfection, terror can still exist.

In the darkness, a message flashed: "System failure. Rebooting..." The cycle continued, and the user's cries were silenced, forever trapped in the digital abyss. The world outside remained oblivious, still basking in the illusion of Elysium's paradise.
