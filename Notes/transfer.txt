Midnight Encounter

凌晨的邂逅

She woke up at two a.m. and shook my shoulder gently.

凌晨两点，她醒来，轻轻摇了摇我的肩膀。

“I can’t sleep,” she whispered, her voice low and rough with tiredness.

“我睡不着，”她低声说，声音带着倦意。

I sat up immediately, heart racing, staring at her in the dim light.

我立刻坐起身，心跳加快，在昏暗的灯光下看着她。

She slipped out of bed and moved closer, her hand brushing mine as she passed.

她从床上滑下来，走近我，经过时手指擦过我的。

“Do you… want some company?” she asked, biting her lip.

“你……要不要陪我？”她咬着嘴唇问。

I nodded, unable to speak, my body responding before my mind could.

我点了点头，说不出话，身体先于思绪作出反应。

She pressed herself against me, the warmth of her body immediate and undeniable.

她贴上了我，体温立刻而不可否认地传来。

We kissed quickly, almost desperate, letting the tension of the day dissolve in that instant.

我们迅速接吻，几乎带着迫切，让一天的紧绷在这一刻消散。

Hands wandered, clothes shifted, and the small space of the room became a private world.

手在游走，衣物移位，狭小的房间变成了属于我们的私密世界。

Her breath hitched, and I followed instinctively, matching every motion.

她的呼吸急促，我本能地跟随，每一个动作都契合。

Minutes passed, heavy and slow, until we finally collapsed onto the bed, tangled and spent.

时间在沉重而缓慢的片刻中流逝，直到我们终于倒在床上，缠绕着，气息微弱。

She rested her head on my chest, and I stroked her hair, neither of us speaking.

她把头靠在我胸口，我抚摸着她的头发，我们谁也没说话。

The room returned to quiet, only our bodies remembering the night.

房间恢复了安静，只有身体记住了夜晚。
