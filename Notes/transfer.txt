# The Constant Companion

The old oscillating fan had served the Chen family faithfully for nearly three decades. Its white plastic casing had yellowed slightly with time, and one of the buttons required a firm press, but it still hummed to life each summer with the same determination it had shown since 1992. For seven-year-old Lily, the fan was more than just an appliance—it was her silent guardian.

During the sweltering Shanghai summers, the fan stood by Lily's bedside, its steady rhythm lulling her to sleep each night. She would whisper her secrets to it, confident that the whirring blades would carry her words to the stars. "When I grow up," she'd say, "I'm going to be an astronaut and visit all the planets you've been telling me about."

As the years passed, Lily grew taller, her interests changed, and eventually she moved away for university. The fan remained in her childhood bedroom, occasionally turned on by her parents during their nostalgic visits to her untouched space. It continued its faithful duty, though now it often spun to an empty room.

When Lily returned home after ten years abroad, she found the house exactly as she remembered it. As the evening grew warm, her mother suggested turning on the air conditioning, but Lily insisted on finding the old fan. With some effort, she located it in the storage room, covered in dust but intact.

As she pressed the stubborn button and the familiar hum filled the room, Lily was transported back to her childhood. The same breeze that had once carried her dreams to the stars now brought tears to her eyes. Some things changed, she realized, but the constants in life—like a faithful fan's hum—remained as steady as ever, connecting who we were to who we have become.
