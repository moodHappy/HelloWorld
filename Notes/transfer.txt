Chapter 8: The Flickering Image

第八章：闪烁的身影

Part 1: The Fading Applause

褪色的掌声

The ceremony ended with a final, hollow round of applause. Miyetsuko felt a sense of exhaustion that no amount of prestige could mask. She left the auditorium quickly, wanting to shed the ceremonial sash and the watchful eyes of her peers.

仪式在最后几声空洞的掌声中结束。美悦子感到一种任何地位都无法掩饰的疲惫。她迅速离开礼堂，急于挣脱身上的礼仪缎带和同龄人注视的目光。

She declined the school’s shared transport and walked toward the gate. Her mind was a whirlpool of the previous night’s chaos and the morning’s strange reprieve. The "Last Line of Defense" felt more like a fraying thread.

她拒绝了学校的统一接送，径直走向校门。她的脑海里全是昨晚的混乱和早晨离奇的喘息机会。这道“最后的防线”感觉更像是一根磨损的细线。

Part 2: The Sighting

目击

As she approached the street leading to the Lin estate, a black sedan caught her eye. It was parked half a block away, near a row of tall hedges. The car was unmistakable—a high-end model with the subtle, silver crest of the Kurosaki family on its door.

当她走到通往林家大宅的街道时，一辆黑色轿车引起了她的注意。它停在半个街区外，靠近一排高耸的树篱。那辆车太容易认了——一辆侧门印着黑崎家微银色家徽的高级车型。

Miyetsuko slowed her pace. The Kurosakis were supposed to be in mourning. Why was their car here, parked in the shadows of her neighborhood?

美悦子放慢了脚步。黑崎家现在本该在办丧事。为什么他们的车会出现在这里，停在她家附近的阴影里？

Part 3: The Shadow in Silk

丝绸中的阴影

A figure emerged from the side gate of a nearby garden. It was a woman with a familiar, fluid grace. She was wearing the grey silk coat Miyetsuko recognized as Saori’s favorite.

一个身影从附近花园的侧门走了出来。那是一个动作带着熟悉的、如流水般优雅的女人。她穿着一件灰色丝绸外套，美悦子认出那是沙织最喜欢的一件。

The woman didn't look around. She walked straight to the car. A hand reached out from the back seat to open the door for her—a gesture of command, not courtesy. The woman paused for a split second, her head bowed in that habitual, submissive way, before disappearing into the velvet interior.

那个女人没有四处张望，径直走向轿车。一只手从后座伸出来为她打开车门——那是命令而非礼貌。女人迟疑了不到一秒，习惯性地低下头示弱，随后消失在丝绒内饰的后座里。

Part 4: The Echo of Doubt

怀疑的回响

The car pulled away quietly, its engine a low hum that faded into the city noise. Miyetsuko stood frozen on the sidewalk. Was that really Saori? And if it was, why was she meeting the Kurosakis on the very day their heir was announced dead?

轿车无声无息地开走了，引擎的低鸣声淹没在城市的杂音中。美悦子僵在人行道上。那真的是沙织吗？如果是，为什么她会在黑崎家继承人宣布死亡的这一天，去见黑崎家的人？

Her hand went instinctively to the necklace under her collar. The cold diamond felt like a lead weight. The "pause" her father had promised suddenly felt like a trap being reset.

她的手本能地摸向衣领下的项链。冰冷的钻石感觉重如铅块。父亲承诺的“暂停”，此刻突然感觉像是一个正在重启的陷阱。
