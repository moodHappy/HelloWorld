Title: The Visitor

At 2 a.m., Mark’s doorbell rang. No one ever came this late. Peeking through the peephole, he saw a man in a black coat, holding a small box.

"Delivery for Mark," the man whispered.

Mark hesitated but took the box. Inside was a single, ticking stopwatch. On its face, the hands moved backward.

A note read: “Turn it over, and see who you really are.”

Curious, Mark flipped the stopwatch—and suddenly remembered everything he had forgotten: past lives, mistakes, and secrets no one could know.

The hands stopped. He looked in the mirror. The reflection wasn’t his own.

如果你想，我可以再写一篇 温情但出乎意料的微小说，情感方向的短小故事也很有意思。

你想试试这个方向吗？
