Chapter 46: The G-Force Kiss

第四十六章：重力之吻

ROAR!!!

吼！！！

The engine didn't just growl; it screamed. The sudden injection of nitrous oxide turned the boat into a rocket.

引擎不仅仅是咆哮；它在尖叫。突然注入的氧化亚氮把这艘船变成了火箭。

The acceleration was brutal.
加速是残暴的。

"Ah!" Miyetsuko lost her balance. The immense G-force threw her backwards.

“啊！”美悦子失去了平衡。巨大的G力把她向后甩去。

She slammed violently into Chen Mo's chest.

她狠狠撞进陈默的怀里。

She didn't try to get back to her seat. She straddled him, wrapping her arms around his neck, burying her face in his shoulder to fight the wind pressure.

她没试图回座位。她跨坐在他身上，双臂死死搂住他的脖子，把脸埋在他的肩膀里对抗风压。

The boat literally flew off the top of a wave. For a second, they were airborne. The propellers spun wildly in the air.

快艇真的从浪尖上飞了起来。有一秒钟，他们在空中。螺旋桨在空气中疯狂空转。

CRASH!

轰！

They landed hard. The impact was absorbed by the shock absorbers of the seats—and by the soft cushion of Miyetsuko's body pressing against Chen Mo.

重重落下。冲击力被座椅的减震器吸收——也被美悦子压在陈默身上的柔软肉体吸收了。
Her chest flattened against his, knocked the wind out of him, but also protected him.

她的胸口压扁在他身上，把他撞得喘不过气，但也保护了他。

Behind them, the second pursuer's engine blew a gasket trying to keep up, trailing black smoke and falling behind.

在他们身后，第二艘追击者的引擎因为试图跟上而爆缸，拖着黑烟被甩在了后面。

They were alone on the open ocean.

他们在广阔的洋面上孤独了。
