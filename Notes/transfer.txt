Chapter 56: The Black Swan

第五十六章：黑天鹅

The Conrad Tokyo. Grand Ballroom.

东京康莱德酒店。大宴会厅。

Flashbulbs popped like strobes. Mishima stood on the stage, basking in the light. Behind him, a massive screen displayed the new logo: Mishima-Kurosaki Industries.

闪光灯像频闪灯一样闪烁。三岛站在台上，沐浴在光芒中。在他身后，巨大的屏幕显示着新Logo：三岛-黑崎重工。

"Today marks a new era," Mishima smiled, his scar stretching. "With the acquisition of Kurosaki, we control 60% of Japan's defense contracts. We are unstoppable."

“今天标志着一个新时代，”三岛微笑着，伤疤拉伸。“随着对黑崎的收购，我们控制了日本60%的国防合同。我们势不可挡。”

"Mr. Mishima!" A reporter raised a hand. "What about the rumors regarding Mrs. Kurosaki? Is she still missing?"

“三岛先生！”一个记者举手。“关于黑崎夫人的传闻呢？她还在失踪吗？”

Mishima's face darkened for a split second, then returned to a mask of polite concern.

三岛的脸阴沉了一瞬，随即恢复了礼貌的关切面具。

"Tragically, yes. We believe she fled the country. Given her... instability... we fear the worst."

“悲剧的是，是的。我们认为她逃离了出境。考虑到她的……精神不稳定……我们担心发生了最坏的情况。”

CREAAAK.

吱——

The massive double doors at the back of the ballroom opened.

宴会厅后方巨大的双开门开了。

It wasn't a servant opening them. It was two large, silent men in black suits.

不是服务员开的。是两个高大、沉默的黑西装男人。

Silence swept through the room like a cold wind.

寂静像冷风一样扫过房间。

Heels clicked on the marble floor. Click. Click. Click.

高跟鞋敲击大理石地板的声音。嗒。嗒。嗒。

Miyetsuko walked in.

美悦子走了进来。

She removed her sunglasses. Her eyes were sharp, clear, and amused.

她摘下墨镜。她的眼睛锐利、清澈，带着笑意。

"I'm not missing, Mishima-san," her voice projected clearly without a microphone. "I was just... shopping."

“我没失踪，三岛先生，”她的声音不用麦克风也很清晰。“我只是……去购物了。”

The reporters gasped. Cameras turned. The flashbulbs went insane.

记者们倒吸一口气。摄像机转动。闪光灯疯了。

Mishima gripped the podium. He looked like he had seen a ghost. A very expensive, very dangerous ghost.

三岛抓紧了讲台。他看起来像见了鬼。一个非常昂贵、非常危险的鬼。

"Miyetsuko..." he whispered.

“美悦子……”他低语。

Chen Mo walked beside her, handing out press packets to the journalists as they passed.

陈默走在她身边，一路给记者分发新闻通稿。

"Rio Pacific Holdings," Miyetsuko continued, walking up the aisle towards the stage. "Just acquired 51% of your debt from the South American banks. Which makes me... your majority creditor."

“里约太平洋控股，”美悦子继续说着，走过过道逼近舞台。“刚刚从南美银行收购了你51%的债务。这让我成为了……你的最大债权人。”

She stopped at the foot of the stage, looking up at him.

她在舞台脚下停住，抬头看着他。

"I didn't come to mourn my husband, Mishima. I came to audit yours."

“我不是来哀悼我丈夫的，三岛。我是来审计你的。”
