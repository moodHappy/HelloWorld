Chapter 35: The Sound of the Zipper

第三十五章：拉链的声音

"We can't go to Yokohama like this,"
Miyetsuko finished the soup and wiped her mouth.

"We need armor."

“我们不能这副样子去横滨。”
她喝完汤，擦嘴。

“我们需要盔甲。”

The old man pointed to the back room.

"Leftover biker gear.
Take what fits."

老头指向后屋。

“暴走族留下的装备。
合身就拿。”

Ten minutes later.
Back room.

十分钟后。
后屋。

Miyetsuko found a black racing suit—tight leather built for speed and protection.

美悦子找到一套黑色赛车服。
紧身皮革，为速度与防护而生。

"Zip me up."

“帮我拉上。”

Chen Mo pulled the zipper slowly.

Zzzzip.

陈默缓慢拉动拉链。

滋——

The sound stretched through the silence.

声音在寂静中被拉长。

When she turned around—
he stopped breathing.

当她转身——
他屏住呼吸。

"Too tight?"

“太紧？”

"Perfect."

“完美。”

She strapped the holster to her thigh.

"Let's go.
The car is outside."

她把枪套绑上大腿。

“走吧。
车在外面。”
