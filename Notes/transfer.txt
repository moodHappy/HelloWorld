The Wedding

The hall smelled of fresh flowers and polished wood. Guests laughed, adjusted dresses and ties, glasses in hand. Tom, the groom, fidgeted with his cufflinks, trying to calm nerves.

Near the entrance, a familiar argument hummed faintly, like a memory made real. Tom recognized them immediately: the couple from Room 615. They were here—seated at a small table near the back. He had thought of them only last night, overheard words through the thin hotel wall: “I’m tired… of always being the one who cares.”

Now, the man tugged at his tie, the woman scrolled through her phone, arms crossed. They were quieter in public, but the tension clung to them like a second skin.

The ceremony began. Vows were exchanged, rings slipped onto fingers, applause followed. Tom’s bride whispered, “Are they… okay?”

Tom glanced toward the couple. The woman finally looked up, and their eyes met for a brief second. She smiled—an almost-laugh, bitter and quick. He nodded. It was acknowledgment enough.

At the reception, the couple moved slowly through the hall. The man offered a polite “Congratulations” as he passed Tom. The woman followed, still tense, still scrolling. Tom realized their argument had not ended; it had just taken the shape of these quiet movements, subtle gestures.

During the first dance, the couple watched from their table. The woman’s hand brushed her hair nervously; the man’s fingers drummed against the table. Tom caught a glimpse of their shared exasperation, a flash of the hotel room argument. Somehow, seeing them here, witnessing their struggle alongside his own celebration, made him appreciate the fragile balance of relationships, the effort required to care without expectation.

Later, the couple excused themselves quietly. Tom’s bride leaned over and whispered, “They need each other, even if they fight.”

Tom nodded, watching them leave. The moment was brief, but it lingered—an echo threading through the wedding, a reminder of patience, tension, and the small, invisible threads connecting lives.
