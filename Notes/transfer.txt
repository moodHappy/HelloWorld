# When Magic Meets Technology

In a world where dragons and spaceships coexist, young wizard Tim tried to upgrade his broomstick. "I'll add some rocket boosters," he said proudly. After attaching them, Tim sat on the broom and shouted "Ignite!" Instead of flying smoothly, the broom spun wildly like a washing machine with a squirrel inside. "Oops," Tim said as he crashed into a pile of rubber chickens. The town's inventor, Professor Gearbox, shook his head. "Magic and technology don't mix well, Tim. That's why we have dragon taxis instead." Tim sheepishly agreed, deciding that sometimes, old-fashioned magic is best.
