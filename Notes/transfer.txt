Hemophilia is a disease. It means that the body has problems stopping bleeding.

In the 1970s and 80s, thousands of hemophilia patients in the UK need new blood. The blood comes from the US. Some blood comes from people who use drugs or prisoners. They are ill. They have hepatitis C or HIV. When patients get the blood, they become ill, too. 3,000 people die. It is a big tragedy for their families. Many people want the government to take responsibility for what happens.

In 2017, an investigation starts. Last week, officials say that the government must pay 125,000 dollars to the families. But it is not the final sum of money.
