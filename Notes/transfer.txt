The small village of Millfield hadn't seen a mystery like this in fifty years. Thomas Jenkins, the reclusive lighthouse keeper, vanished without a trace. One evening he was tending to his lamp; the next morning his cottage stood empty, breakfast untouched. The only anomaly was a strange symbol burned into the floor near the door. Sheriff Miller found no clues, no witnesses, no explanation. Thomas was simply gone. The case remains unsolved, another entry in the town's history of unexplained disappearances that locals whisper about on foggy nights when the lighthouse beam seems to search for someone lost to the mysteries beyond.
