Chapter 13: The Suffocation in the Fitting Room

第十三章：试衣间的窒息

"Distract the guard? How?" Chen Mo looked at her through the mirror.

“引开保安？怎么引？”陈默透过镜子看着她。

Miyetsuko smiled. She suddenly dropped the tape measure, turned Chen Mo around, and pushed him against the mirror.

美悦子笑了。她突然丢掉软尺，把陈默转过来，推到了镜子上。

"Like this..."

“像这样……”

She grabbed Chen Mo's hand and placed it on her waist, then guided it upwards, climbing over the steep curve of her ribs, until it completely covered that astonishing fullness.

她抓着陈默的手，按在自己的腰上，然后引导着向上，攀过那陡峭的肋骨曲线，直到完全覆盖住那惊人的饱满。

"The security guard at the Logistics Center is a lecherous heavy drinker. If a drunk, lost, lonely noblewoman stumbles into his arms..."

“物流中心的保安是个好色的酒鬼。如果一个喝醉了、迷路了、寂寞的贵妇，跌跌撞撞地倒在他怀里……”

"You're going to use yourself as bait?" Chen Mo's fingers sank into the soft flesh; anger flared up in his heart again. "I thought you were the Queen, not a prostitute."

“你要用自己当诱饵？”陈默的手指陷入软肉中，心里莫名又起了一股火。“我以为你是女王，不是妓女。”

"Watch your mouth, boy." Miyetsuko's eyes turned cold, but her body pressed closer, sandwiching Chen Mo between her and the mirror. The mirror immediately fogged up from their heat.

“注意你的措辞，小子。”美悦子眼神一冷，但身体却贴得更紧，把陈默夹在她和镜子之间。镜面顿时因为两人的热度起了一层雾气。

"I use all available resources. Including myself."

“我利用一切可利用的资源。包括我自己。”

She stood on tiptoes, her lips hovering an inch from Chen Mo's.

她踮起脚尖，嘴唇悬在离陈默一寸的地方。

"Are you jealous? Chen Mo."

“你在吃醋吗？陈默。”

"I'm worried you'll mess up the plan." Chen Mo retorted stiffly.

“我是在担心你搞砸计划。”陈默僵硬地反驳。

"Is that so?" She chuckled softly, then suddenly pressed her hips forward, grinding firmly against Chen Mo.

“是吗？”她低笑一声，然后突然挺起胯部，结结实实地顶了陈默一下。

Through the layers of fabric—her silk dress, his suit pants—Chen Mo could feel the terrifying heat and maturity of her body. It was a ripe, juicy texture that young girls could never possess. She was like a vortex, trying to suck his soul in.

隔着层层布料——她的丝绸裙，他的西装裤——陈默能感觉到她身体那恐怖的热度和成熟度。那是青涩少女绝对无法拥有的、熟透了的多汁质感。她像个漩涡，要把他的魂魄都吸进去。

"Your body is more honest than your mouth. It's hard."

“你的身体比你的嘴诚实。硬了。”

She reached out, patting Chen Mo's cheek gently, like soothing a restless pet.

她伸出手，轻轻拍了拍陈默的脸颊，像是在安抚一只躁动的宠物。

"Save this energy for the 24th. If we succeed, we can celebrate in the server room. I heard... the noise of the cooling fans covers up the sound of screaming very well."

“把这股劲儿留到24号。如果我们成功了，我们可以在机房里庆祝。听说……散热风扇的噪音，很能掩盖叫床声。”

She pulled away, straightened her dress, and regained her icy demeanor instantly.

她抽身离开，整理好裙摆，瞬间恢复了冰冷的神态。

"Put on your clothes. We have a war to fight."

“穿好衣服。我们要去打仗了。”
