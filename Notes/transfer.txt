Outside the Tailor Shop
裁缝店门外


He stopped for a moment on the cracked sidewalk, just outside the faded sign: Chen’s Tailoring. The bell above the door didn’t ring—he had known that already—but something about the dull reflection of the streetlight on the dusty window made him pause. He adjusted the strap of his messenger bag and shifted his weight from one foot to the other, unsure why he was looking.

街灯下，他在人行道的裂缝旁停了停，就在那块褪色的招牌——陈氏裁缝店——前。门上的铃不再响——他早就知道了——但窗户上灰尘映出的昏黄光影让他犹豫了一下。他调整了一下挎包的肩带，重心在两脚间微微摇摆，不明白自己为什么会停下。

He remembered the conversation in the apartment earlier that evening. His wife had asked about the tailor shop on a whim, a casual mention of a place she had walked past years ago. He had nodded, said something indifferent, but now, walking past the street, the words seemed heavier than they were.

他想起今晚在公寓里的谈话。妻子随口提起这家几年前路过的裁缝店。他点了点头，说了句无关紧要的话，但现在，当他再次走过这条街，那句话却比当时沉重了许多。

The air smelled faintly of rain and dust. He watched a woman cross the street carrying grocery bags, her steps quick, hands gripping the handles. He recognized the tension in her shoulders—the same tension he felt himself sometimes—and wondered where she was going. Then he realized he didn’t care.

空气中带着微微的雨水和尘土的味道。他看着一个妇女拎着购物袋过街，步子匆忙，手紧握把手。他看懂她肩上的紧绷感——那种他自己偶尔也会有的紧张——但他意识到自己并不在意她要去哪儿。

He lingered for a moment longer, eyes on the window. The mannequins inside were still draped in unfinished garments, seams pinned as if frozen in time. For a second, he imagined someone kneeling over a piece of cloth, hands moving carefully, shaping something that would never exist. The thought was oddly comforting.

他又停留了片刻，目光落在窗户上。里面的人体模型依旧披着未完成的衣服，接缝固定着，仿佛被时间凝固。瞬间，他想象有人跪在布料前，手在小心地移动，塑造着永远不会存在的东西。这个念头出奇地让他心安。

Finally, he moved on, his shoes crunching on the sidewalk. The street stretched ahead, empty except for the distant hum of a tram. The tailor and the shop remained behind, quiet and persistent, folding life into careful seams without asking for acknowledgment. He didn’t look back, but a small part of him carried the image with him, like a thread tied loosely to his memory.

最终，他继续前行，鞋子踩在人行道的碎石上发出轻响。前方的街道空旷，只有远处电车的嗡鸣。裁缝和商店静静地留在身后，沉默而持久，将生活折叠成仔细的接缝，不求认同。他没有回头，但心底有一小部分，将这个画面像线一样松松地系在记忆里。
