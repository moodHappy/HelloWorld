One sunny morning, Sam was walking to the park. He enjoyed his daily routine. At the park, he saw his friend, Lily, sitting on a bench under a tree. "Hey, Sam!" she called out. Sam waved and walked over. "What are you doing today?" he asked. Lily replied, "I'm just reading my book. Want to join me?" Sam agreed and they spent the day chatting and laughing. It was a lovely day, filled with simple moments of everyday life.
