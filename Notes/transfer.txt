Sarah’s heart pounded. The library felt different now—walls taller, shadows deeper. She flipped the book open, revealing a map of the library with rooms that didn’t exist on any floor plan she’d ever seen. A low whisper seemed to drift from the shelves: “Follow the story, or be forgotten.”

<i>萨拉的心狂跳不止。此刻图书馆感觉不同——墙壁更高，阴影更深。她翻开那本书，发现里面竟是一张图书馆的地图，上面标注着她从未见过的房间。书架间似乎飘来低声细语：“跟随故事，否则将被遗忘。”</i>

Against her better judgment, she stepped past the fiction aisle into a corridor that hadn’t been there moments ago. The air smelled of old paper and secrets. At the end, a door creaked open, revealing a room lined with glowing tomes. One floated toward her, pages flipping on their own.

<i>违背直觉，她还是踏过小说区，走入一条刚刚还不存在的走廊。空气中弥漫着旧纸张与秘密的气息。走廊尽头，一扇门吱呀作响地打开，露出一间排列着发光书籍的房间。其中一本漂浮向她，自行翻页。</i>

“Read me,” it beckoned.

<i>“读我。”它招手示意。</i>

Sarah realized some knowledge wasn’t meant for casual discovery—but curiosity, once sparked, demanded obedience. She opened the book, and the library exhaled around her.

<i>萨拉意识到，有些知识不适合随意探索——但一旦好奇心被点燃，就必须服从。她翻开书，图书馆仿佛在她周围缓缓呼吸。</i>
