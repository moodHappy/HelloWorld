A video shows a student named Noh Huyn-soo. He is eating a banana.  The banana is part of an artwork at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul.

Noh says that he is hungry. He takes the banana off the wall.  He eats it in front of people. They are surprised. Noh puts the peel back on the wall. Maurizio Cattelan is the artist. He puts a new banana on the wall every few days. He has no problem with what Noh does.

This is not the first time someone eats a banana from this artwork. In 2019, another person eats a banana from it at an exhibition in Miami.
