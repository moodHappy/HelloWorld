The old windmill stood proudly on the hill, its blades catching the morning breeze. For decades, it had served the village, grinding grain into flour. Children would gather around, mesmerized by its turning sails. As time passed, newer technologies emerged, and the windmill fell into disuse. One day, young Emma decided to restore it. With the community's help, they repaired the sails and mechanism. Now, the windmill turns again, not just grinding grain but also generating power. It stands as a reminder that sometimes, the old ways, combined with new ideas, can create something beautiful and sustainable.
