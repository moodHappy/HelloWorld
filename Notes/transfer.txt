Chapter 57: The Armor of Silk and Diamonds

第五十七章：丝绸与钻石的铠甲

The Presidential Suite looked like a battlefield of luxury. Open boxes from Chanel, Dior, and Cartier were scattered everywhere, spilling tissue paper like white foam.

总统套房看起来像个奢华的战场。香奈儿、迪奥和卡地亚的打开的盒子到处都是，像白色泡沫一样溢出了薄页纸。

Miyetsuko stood before the full-length mirror. She had chosen a backless evening gown in "Vengeance Red."

美悦子站在落地镜前。她选了一件“复仇红”的露背晚礼服。

It was silk, cool and fluid like water. When she slipped it on, the fabric glided over her raw, sensitive skin, soothing the angry red marks left by the canvas jumpsuit.

那是丝绸做的，像水一样凉爽流畅。当她穿上它时，布料滑过她红肿敏感的皮肤，抚慰着帆布连体服留下的愤怒红痕。

"Zip me up," she commanded, turning her back to Chen Mo again.

“帮我拉上，”她命令道，再次背对陈默。

This time, there was no sound of friction. The invisible zipper glided up smoothly, sealing her heavy, soft body inside the expensive fabric. The dress was cut dangerously low in the front and dangerously high at the thigh slit. It didn't just cover her; it framed her like a weapon.

这一次，没有摩擦声。隐形拉链顺滑地上升，将她沉重、柔软的身体封印在昂贵的布料里。这件礼服前胸开得危险地低，大腿的开叉开得危险地高。它不仅仅是遮盖她；它像包装武器一样展示她。

"Does it hurt?" Chen Mo asked, his fingers lingering on her exposed spine.

“还疼吗？”陈默问，手指在她裸露的脊椎上流连。

"The silk feels like a kiss," she shivered, leaning back against him. "But my nipples are still... throbbing. They are so hard they're pushing against the silk."

“丝绸感觉像个吻，”她颤抖着，向后靠在他身上。“但我的乳头还在……跳动。它们硬得顶着丝绸。”

Chen Mo reached into a jewelry box. He pulled out a diamond necklace—a choker style with a ruby drop that sat right in her cleavage.

陈默伸手进首饰盒。他拿出一条钻石项链——是一条颈圈款式的，一颗红宝石水滴坠子正好落在她的乳沟里。

He clasped it around her neck. The cold metal made her gasp.

他把它扣在她脖子上。冰冷的金属让她倒吸一口气。

"A collar," she whispered, touching the diamonds. "For your pet?"

“项圈，”她低声说，摸着钻石。“给你的宠物的？”

"For my Queen," Chen Mo corrected her. He put on a bespoke tuxedo, hiding the Glock 19 in the inner pocket. "Ready to go to dinner?"

“给我的女王，”陈默纠正她。他穿上一套定制的无尾礼服，把格洛克19藏在内袋里。“准备好去吃晚餐了吗？”

"I'm starving," her eyes gleamed in the mirror. "I want to eat something bloody."

“我饿坏了，”镜子里她的眼睛在发光。“我想吃点带血的东西。”
