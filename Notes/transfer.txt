Chapter 22: The Black Rain

第二十二章：黑雨

"Shipment clear! We are rich!" Fantasma roared, firing his golden gun into the air.

“货物放行！我们要发财了！”幽灵咆哮着，朝天鸣枪。

The celebration was cut short by a sound. Not a gunshot. But a low, humming vibration that shook the corrugated iron roof.

庆祝声被一个声音打断了。不是枪声。而是一种低沉的、震动波纹铁皮屋顶的嗡嗡声。

Chen Mo's eyes snapped to his laptop screen.

陈默的眼睛猛地转向电脑屏幕。

"Thermal spikes on the roof. Four... no, six targets. Fast roping down."

“屋顶有热源反应。四个……不，六个目标。正在索降。”

"Kurosaki?" Miyetsuko stood up, the playful lust vanishing instantly.

“黑崎？”美悦子站起身，嬉戏的欲望瞬间消失。

"Worse. 'The Cleaners'. His personal death squad. They don't take prisoners."

“更糟。‘清道夫’。他的私人行刑队。他们不留活口。”

CRASH!

轰！

The skylights shattered. Six figures in full black tactical armor dropped into the warehouse on ropes. They moved like machines, silent and deadly.

天窗炸裂。六个全副武装的黑色战术装甲身影顺着绳索降入仓库。他们像机器一样移动，无声且致命。

Red laser sights cut through the dust, all converging on one target: The woman in white.

红色激光瞄准器切开尘埃，全部汇聚在一个目标上：那个穿白西装的女人。

"Kill the woman. Secure the data," a synthesized voice boomed.

“杀掉那个女人。夺取数据，”一个合成音轰鸣。

Fantasma's thugs raised their AK-47s, but they were cut down instantly by precise, suppressed fire. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Bodies hit the floor.

幽灵的打手举起AK-47，但瞬间被精准的消音射击放倒。噗。噗。噗。 尸体倒地。

Miyetsuko stood frozen for a split second. The lasers were painting her chest like a target board.

美悦子僵住了一秒。激光点像靶心一样涂满了她的胸口。
