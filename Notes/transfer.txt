Chapter 14: The Coat and the Beast

第十四章：风衣与野兽

October 24th. The rain in Tokyo was heavier than expected, hitting the windshield like bullets.

10月24日。东京的雨比预想的还要大，像子弹一样砸在挡风玻璃上。

Chen Mo sat in the driver's seat of a black unobtrusive sedan, his hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned white. In the rearview mirror, the "Bay Area Logistics Center" loomed in the rain like a giant crouching steel beast.

陈默坐在一辆不起眼的黑色轿车驾驶座上，双手紧握方向盘，指关节泛白。后视镜里，“湾区物流中心”在雨幕中像一只蹲伏的钢铁巨兽。

"Relax. The weather is on our side."

“放松点。这鬼天气是站在我们这边的。”

Miyetsuko sat in the passenger seat, checking her makeup in the mirror.

美悦子坐在副驾驶，对着镜子补妆。

Tonight, she wore a camel-colored trench coat, tightly belted at the waist. Underneath, she wore nothing but sheer stockings and a slip dress that was criminally short. The coat wrapped her voluptuous figure tightly, looking decent and severe, but Chen Mo knew what kind of explosive scenery lay beneath that layer of fabric.

今晚她穿了一件驼色风衣，腰带系得很紧。而在那之下，除了薄如蝉翼的丝袜，只有一件短得犯罪的吊带裙。风衣将她那丰腴的身段包裹得严严实实，看起来端庄严厉，但陈默知道，那一层布料下面藏着怎样炸裂的风景。

"Remember the plan?" She snapped the compact shut, the sound crisp in the quiet car.

“记得计划吗？”她合上粉饼盒，声音在安静的车厢里格外清脆。

"I wait for the signal. When the guard leaves the post, I have 30 seconds to swipe the card and enter the side door." Chen Mo recited mechanically.

“我等信号。当保安离开岗亭，我有30秒的时间刷卡进入侧门。”陈默机械地背诵。

"Good." Miyetsuko reached over, her cold hand patting Chen Mo's thigh. "If I don't come back in 15 minutes... run."

“很好。”美悦子伸过手，冰凉的手掌拍了拍陈默的大腿。“如果15分钟后我没回来……你就跑。”

"What about you?"

“那你呢？”

"Don't worry about me. I have my ways of dealing with men." She smiled, a desolate yet enchanting smile. "Especially men who haven't touched a woman in a long time."

“别担心我。我对付男人有我的办法。”她笑了，笑容凄艳又妩媚。“特别是那种很久没碰过女人的男人。”

She pushed the door open and stepped into the heavy rain. The high heels clicked on the wet asphalt, a rhythm of death and desire.

她推开车门，走进了大雨中。高跟鞋敲击在湿漉漉的沥青路面上，那是死亡与欲望的节奏。
