"Hey, where you from?" the guy at the party asked, eyeing my accent.

"Originally? China," I said, sipping my drink.

"Nah, really? You don't look like it!"

I laughed. "Been here ten years, man. What do you expect?"

"Just curious, that's all. Your English is pretty good!"

"Thanks, I guess? People still ask me this every week."

"It's cool though! Diversity and all that jazz."

"Yeah, well, sometimes I just wanna be 'that guy' without the geography lesson."

"Fair enough," he nodded. "Another beer?"

"Now you're talking!"
