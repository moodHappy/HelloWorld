Chapter 31: The Headline in the Champagne

第三十一章：香槟里的头条

Rio de Janeiro. The Copacabana Palace Hotel. The Penthouse Terrace.

里约热内卢。科帕卡巴纳皇宫酒店。顶层露台。

Miyetsuko sat on the balcony rail, the ocean wind playing with the hem of her silk robe. She held a tablet in one hand and a glass of Mimosa in the other.

美悦子坐在阳台栏杆上，海风戏弄着她丝绸睡袍的下摆。她一手拿着平板电脑，一手端着含羞草鸡尾酒。

"He's gone," she whispered, her voice devoid of emotion.

“他完了，”她低声说，声音里没有一丝感情。

On the screen, strictly bold Japanese characters screamed the headline:

"SCANDAL: Defense Minister Resigns. Kurosaki Soichiro Arrested for Treason and Bribery. Kurosaki Heavy Industries to be Acquired by Mishima Group."

屏幕上，粗黑的日文标题尖叫着：

“丑闻：防卫大臣辞职。黑崎宗一郎因叛国罪和行贿罪被捕。黑崎重工将被三岛财团收购。”

"We won," Chen Mo walked out, placing a plate of sliced mangoes on the table. He was shirtless, a towel draped around his neck, his hair still wet from a swim.

“我们赢了，”陈默走出来，把一盘切好的芒果放在桌上。他赤裸着上身，脖子上挂着条毛巾，头发还湿漉漉的，刚游完泳。

"Did we?" Miyetsuko turned the tablet to him. Her eyes were dark. "Look at the stock price. Mishima's shares jumped 40% overnight. He didn't just buy Kurosaki's company; he bought his connections, his private army, and... his hatred."

“是吗？”美悦子把平板转给他看。她的眼神阴暗。“看股价。三岛的股票一夜之间跳涨了40%。他不仅仅买下了黑崎的公司；他买下了黑崎的人脉、私人军队，还有……他的仇恨。”

She hopped off the railing. The silk robe fluttered open, revealing her tanned, smooth legs. She walked to Chen Mo, wrapping her arms around his wet waist, burying her face in his chest.

她跳下栏杆。丝绸睡袍飘开，露出她晒成小麦色、光滑的双腿。她走向陈默，双臂环住他湿漉漉的腰，把脸埋进他的胸口。

"I feel cold, Chen. Even in this heat. Mishima is different. Kurosaki wanted to punish me. Mishima... he wants to own me."

“我觉得冷，陈。即使在这么热的天气里。三岛不一样。黑崎想惩罚我。而三岛……他想占有我。”

Chen Mo tightened his arms around her. He could feel her trembling slightly against his skin.

陈默收紧了双臂。他能感觉到她贴着他的皮肤在微微颤抖。

"Let him try," Chen Mo kissed the top of her head. "He's in Tokyo. We are in Rio. He can't touch you here."

“让他试试，”陈默吻了吻她的头顶。“他在东京。我们在里约。不在这儿他碰不到你。”

"You underestimate a man with a new toy," she looked up, her lips brushing his chin. "He has Kurosaki's satellites now. And he has something Kurosaki didn't have: patience."

“你低估了一个拿到新玩具的男人，”她抬起头，嘴唇擦过他的下巴。“他现在有了黑崎的卫星。而且他有一样黑崎没有的东西：耐心。”
