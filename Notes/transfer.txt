Captain Zara and her crew glided their cloaked ship alongside the luxury space cruiser "Starlight." Their mission: steal the rare energy crystal hidden in the captain's vault. With precision timing, they boarded, bypassed security systems, and located the prize. As Zara reached for the crystal, alarms blared. "We've been made!" she shouted. Racing back to their ship, laser fire erupted around them. They escaped with the crystal, but not without damage. As they jumped to hyperspace, Zara smiled. Another successful heist for the infamous space thieves known across the galaxy.
