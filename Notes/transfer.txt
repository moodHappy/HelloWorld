Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a hardworking farmer named Tom. One day, while plowing his fields, he discovered a hidden treasure chest. Excited, he opened it to find a magical seed. Intrigued, he planted it in his garden.

Overnight, a magnificent tree grew, its branches reaching the sky. A bird with shimmering feathers perched on the tree, singing a melodious tune. The bird was a messenger from the heavens, granting Tom one wish.

Tom wished for happiness and prosperity for his village. The tree's fruit brought joy, and the village flourished. Tom learned the true value of sharing and the magic of giving.
