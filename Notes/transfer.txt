The orange tabby cat claimed the street corner as his kingdom. Each afternoon, as the sun slanted through the buildings, he would stretch languidly in the warm patch of light. Passersby occasionally dropped treats, which he accepted with regal indifference. Children pointed, adults smiled, and the cat merely blinked in the golden glow. The afternoon sun was his companion, warming his fur and painting his closed eyelids with dreams of mice and comfortable laps. As shadows grew long, he would rise, shake off the dust, and disappear into the alleyways, leaving the corner empty until tomorrow's sun returned.
