Chapter 27: 900 Watts of Fury

第二十七章：九百瓦的愤怒

The microwave dinged. It sounded absurdly cheerful in the deadly quiet room.

微波炉“叮”了一声。在死寂的房间里，这声音听起来极其荒谬和欢快。
Inside was a sealed glass flask filled with the high-proof whiskey, heated to a critical point. A crude, unstable bomb.

里面是一个密封的玻璃烧瓶，装满了高度威士忌，已经被加热到了临界点。一个简陋、不稳定的炸弹。

"Get down behind the sofa!" Chen Mo roared, grabbing the scorching flask with a towel.

“趴到沙发后面去！”陈默吼道，用毛巾裹住滚烫的烧瓶抓了出来。

At the same instant, the front door was kicked open with a massive crash. Three burly figures in work uniforms stormed in, silhouetted against the hallway light, guns raised.

同一瞬间，前门在一声巨响中被踢开。三个穿着工作服的魁梧身影冲了进来，逆着走廊的灯光，举着枪。

Chen Mo threw the flask with all his might.

陈默用尽全力扔出了烧瓶。

It smashed against the chest of the leading assassin. The superheated alcohol vapor ignited instantly upon contact with the air and the friction.

它砸在了领头杀手的胸口。过热的酒精蒸汽在接触空气和摩擦的瞬间被点燃。

BOOM!

轰！

A fireball engulfed the hallway. The lead assassin screamed, a terrible sound of a burning throat, and stumbled back, knocking down the two behind him. The smell of burnt hair, expensive alcohol, and ozone filled the air.

一团火球吞没了走廊。领头的杀手发出惨叫，那是喉咙被烧灼的可怕声音，他向后踉跄，撞倒了身后的两人。空气里充满了烧焦的头发、昂贵的酒精和臭氧的味道。

"Now!" Chen Mo grabbed Miyetsuko's hand.

“走！”陈默抓住美悦子的手。
