Chapter 55: The Suite Above the Clouds

第五十五章：云端之上的套房

Hotel New Otani Makuhari. The Presidential Suite on the 40th floor.

幕张新大谷酒店。40层的总统套房。

The receptionist looked at the two people in filthy, smelly mechanic jumpsuits with suspicion. But when the black card swiped successfully—and showed a balance that could buy the hotel—her expression instantly changed to a professional, terrified smile.

前台接待员怀疑地看着这两个穿着肮脏、发臭机械师连体服的人。但当那张黑卡刷卡成功——并显示出一个能买下这家酒店的余额时——她的表情瞬间变成了职业而惶恐的微笑。

"Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka. Your luggage..."

“欢迎，田中先生、田中太太。您的行李……”

"We have no luggage," Miyetsuko said coldly, leaning on the marble counter. The smell of diesel wafted from her. "Call the nearest Chanel and Hermes boutiques. Tell them to bring their entire new season collection to my room. In 30 minutes. Or I buy this hotel and fire you."

“我们没有行李，”美悦子冷冷地说，靠在大理石柜台上。柴油味从她身上散发出来。“给最近的香奈儿和爱马仕精品店打电话。让他们把当季的所有新款送到我房间。30分钟内。否则我就买下这家酒店，然后解雇你。”

They took the private elevator up.

他们坐上了私人电梯。

As the doors closed, Miyetsuko collapsed against the mirrored wall. The adrenaline of the confrontation faded, replaced by the sheer physical torture of the rough fabric.

随着电梯门关闭，美悦子瘫软在镜面墙上。对抗带来的肾上腺素消退了，取而代之的是粗糙布料带来的纯粹肉体折磨。

"Get this off me," she whimpered. "Now."

“帮我脱掉这个，”她呜咽道。“现在。”
