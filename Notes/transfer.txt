Man, last night was something else. After a few too many drinks, I stumbled out of the bar and everything looked... different. The streetlights were dancing, the buildings swaying gently like they were grooving to some silent music. People's faces became paintings of emotion, their words turning into colorful bubbles floating in the air. You know, it's funny how alcohol lets you see the world without all the filters we normally use. Everything felt more real and yet completely unreal at the same time. Maybe we all need to see the world through drunken eyes sometimes, just to remember what it's like to truly feel alive.
