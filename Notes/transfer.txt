Chapter 55: The Rain in Haneda

第五十五章：羽田的冷雨

Haneda Airport. VIP Terminal.

羽田机场。VIP航站楼。

It was raining in Tokyo. Of course it was.

东京在下雨。当然在下雨。

A black convoy of Maybachs waited on the tarmac.

一队黑色的迈巴赫车队停在停机坪上。

Miyetsuko stepped off the plane. She wore large sunglasses and a wide-brimmed black hat. The wind caught her velvet dress, revealing the dangerous slit up her thigh.

美悦子走下飞机。她戴着大墨镜和宽檐黑帽。风吹起她的天鹅绒裙摆，露出大腿上危险的开叉。

A customs officer hurried over, holding an umbrella.

一名海关官员撑着伞匆忙跑过来。

"Ms. Tanaka? Welcome back. Your papers are in order. 'Rio Pacific Holdings' has been granted diplomatic clearance."

“田中女士？欢迎回来。您的文件没问题。‘里约太平洋控股’已经获得了外交豁免许可。”

"Thank you," she didn't look at him. She looked at the grey skyline of Tokyo. The towers looked like tombstones.

“谢谢，”她没看他。她看着东京灰色的天际线。那些高楼看起来像墓碑。

Chen Mo walked beside her, holding a briefcase. He wore a charcoal grey suit, cut to hide the holster under his arm. He looked like the perfect corporate shark.

陈默走在她身边，提着公文包。他穿着炭灰色西装，剪裁巧妙地隐藏了腋下的枪套。他看起来像个完美的企业鲨鱼。

"Mishima is at the Conrad Hotel," Chen Mo checked his watch. "The press conference starts in 30 minutes."

“三岛在康莱德酒店，”陈默看了看表。“新闻发布会30分钟后开始。”

"Let's go say hello," Miyetsuko got into the back of the lead Maybach. "I hope he likes surprises."

“去打个招呼，”美悦子钻进领头迈巴赫的后座。“希望他喜欢惊喜。”

Inside the car, the leather seats were heated. But Miyetsuko shivered.

车里，真皮座椅是加热的。但美悦子打了个寒颤。

Chen Mo took her hand. His hand was warm, calloused—a reminder of the jungle.

陈默握住她的手。他的手温暖、粗糙——那是丛林的提醒。

"He thinks you are dead," Chen Mo whispered. "Use that."

“他以为你死了，”陈默低语。“利用这一点。”
