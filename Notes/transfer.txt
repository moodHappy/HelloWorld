Chapter 10: The Gold Chain Bondage

第十章：金链的束缚

The door to the suite closed. The noise of the carnival was instantly cut off.

套房门关上了。狂欢节的噪音瞬间被切断。

Miyetsuko didn't wait to get to the bed. She pushed Chen Mo against the heavy mahogany door.

美悦子没等走到床边。她把陈默推到了厚重的红木门上。

"Did you see that?" she gasped, her hands tearing at his belt. "The blood... the noise... the power..."

“你看到了吗？”她喘息着，双手撕扯着他的皮带。“那些血……那些声音……那种力量……”

"You are sick," Chen Mo grabbed her wrists, pinning them above her head.

“你真变态，”陈默抓住她的手腕，把它们按在她头顶。

"I'm hungry," she bit his neck, hard. "Feed me, Chen. Fuck the fear out of me."

“我饿了，”她狠狠咬住他的脖子。“喂饱我，陈。把恐惧从我身体里操出去。”

The gold chains of her outfit were a hindrance and a toy.

她那一身金链既是阻碍，也是玩具。

Chen Mo reached for her chest. The chains were heavy and cold, creating a cage over her soft, hot flesh. He didn't remove them. Instead, he pulled them aside.

陈默伸手去抓她的胸口。金链沉重冰冷，在她柔软滚烫的肉体上构成了一个笼子。他没有解开它们。相反，他把它们拨到一边。

The metal links dragged over her sensitive nipples, pinching and scratching.

金属链环拖过她敏感的乳头，夹痛、刮擦着皮肤。

"Ah!" Miyetsuko cried out, half in pain, half in pleasure. The friction of the metal against her swollen peaks was electric.

“啊！”美悦子叫了出来，一半是痛，一半是爽。金属摩擦她肿胀顶端的感觉像触电一样。

"You like that?" Chen Mo teased, twisting the chains tighter around her breasts, making them bulge out even more.

“喜欢吗？”陈默挑逗道，把金链在她乳房上缠得更紧，让它们鼓胀得更厉害。

"Yes... tighter..." she begged.

“是……再紧点……”她乞求道。

He lifted her up. Her legs wrapped around his waist. The gold-plated derringer on her thigh pressed cold against his skin.

他把她抱了起来。她的双腿缠在他的腰上。大腿上那把镀金的德林加手枪冰冷地贴着他的皮肤。

"The gun..." Chen Mo muttered.

“枪……”陈默嘟囔着。

"Leave it," she hissed. "I want to feel it between us. A loaded gun... inside a loaded woman."

“别管它，”她嘶嘶地说。“我想感觉它在我们中间。一把上膛的枪……在一个上膛的女人身体里。”

He carried her to the bed—a massive circular mattress floating in the center of a private indoor pool.

他抱着她走到床边——那是一个漂浮在私人室内泳池中央的巨大圆形床垫。

They fell onto it. The water beneath the mattress rippled, creating a sensation of weightlessness.

他们倒在上面。床垫下的水波荡漾，制造出一种失重感。

Miyetsuko was on her back. The gold mesh bikini bottom was torn aside. The chains clinked rhythmically as she writhed. She looked like a sacrifice on a golden altar—exposed, adorned, and desperate.

美悦子仰躺着。金网比基尼下装被扯到一边。随着她的扭动，金链发出有节奏的撞击声。她看起来像是在金色祭坛上的祭品——暴露、华丽、绝望。

"Make me forget Kurosaki," she looked into Chen Mo's eyes, tears of excitement streaming down her face. "Make me forget everything except this moment."

“让我忘了黑崎，”她看着陈默的眼睛，兴奋的泪水流过脸颊。“让我忘了所有事，只记得这一刻。”

And Chen Mo did. He drove into her with the fury of a man who had almost died an hour ago. The sound of flesh slapping against flesh mixed with the jingle of gold chains, echoing in the soundproof room like a pagan hymn.

陈默做到了。他带着一个一小时前差点死掉的男人的狂怒冲进她的身体。肉体拍打的声音混合着金链的叮当声，在隔音房间里回荡，像一首异教徒的赞美诗。
