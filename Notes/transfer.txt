"Ordering Food at a Restaurant"

So I walk into this little Chinese place, and the waiter comes right over. "What can I get for you?" he asks. I'm like, "Umm, what's good here?" He points to the Kung Pao chicken. "That's popular," he says. Cool, I'll try that. And some egg rolls to start. "You want rice with that?" Yeah, sure. White rice. "Anything to drink?" Just water, thanks. He nods and walks away. I'm kinda nervous I ordered something weird, but when the food comes... whoa! It's amazing! Definitely ordering this again next time.
