Tomorrow I am going to attend a funeral for a great-uncle I've never met. Mother received the call last night - Uncle Robert, her mother's brother, passed away peacefully in his sleep. Though we lived in the same city, our paths never crossed. Family politics kept us apart. Now, as I select my black suit, I wonder about the man I'll never know. Mother says he loved jazz and had a collection of vintage hats. Strange how death can bridge distances that life couldn't. Tomorrow, I'll stand among strangers who share my blood, mourning a man who was both family and a mystery.
