Chapter 14: The Stranger's Scent

第十四章：陌生人的气息

The house was quiet when they returned. Her parents were still downstairs, likely staring at the shop's ledgers in gloomy silence. Miyetsuko headed up to her room, but as she passed Mizuki’s door, she noticed it was slightly ajar. A strange, heavy scent drifted into the hallway—something like expensive tobacco and leather.

回到家时，屋里很安静。父母大概还在楼下，对着店里的账本愁眉不展。美悦子上楼回房，经过美月眠门口时，发现门虚掩着。一股陌生而厚重的气息飘进走廊，像是某种昂贵的烟草夹杂着皮革味。

She pushed the door open just an inch. Draped over the back of Mizuki’s vanity chair was a large, black leather jacket. It was definitely not their father’s style. It looked rugged, expensive, and far too big for a high school girl. Miyetsuko felt a surge of curiosity mixed with a newfound sense of leverage.

她轻轻推开门。美月眠梳妆椅的靠背上搭着一件黑色大皮衣。那绝对不是父亲的风格，看上去很粗犷、很值钱，对一个高中女生来说也太大了。美悦子感到一阵好奇，同时也意识到自己又握住了一份筹码。

"Snooping isn't a good look for a 'model student', you know." Mizuki’s voice came from the shadows behind the door. She was sitting on the floor, leaning against her bed, looking more exhausted than she had at the mall. She didn't try to hide the jacket; instead, she looked at it with a strange, bittersweet expression.

“‘模范生’偷窥别人房间可不太好哦。”美月眠的声音从门后的阴影里传出。她正坐在地板上靠着床，看起来比在商场时还要疲惫。她没打算藏那件外套，反而盯着它，神情透着一种复杂的苦涩。
