# A Rice Farmer's Day

I wake up before dawn, around 4 AM, when the rooster crows. Gotta get to the fields before it gets too hot. First, I feed my water buffalo, then head out to the rice paddies. Morning is for planting and pulling weeds. By noon, I'm sweating buckets, but a quick lunch break under a shady tree helps. Afternoon is for checking water levels and fixing irrigation ditches. Sometimes birds try to eat my young shoots, so I have to shoo them away. Evenings are for counting my blessings and enjoying a simple dinner with my family. Being a rice farmer is tough work, but there's something peaceful about growing food from the earth.
