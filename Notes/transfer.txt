Emma woke up with a raw, scratchy feeling in her throat. Each swallow felt like swallowing glass. She knew the symptoms well â€“ it was pharyngitis again. The tea with honey offered temporary relief as she canceled her plans for the day. By afternoon, her voice was reduced to a painful whisper.

As she curled up with a book, Emma reflected on how something so small could bring her busy life to a complete halt, forcing her to finally slow down.
