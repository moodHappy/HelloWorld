Chapter 20: The White Queen of the Docks

第二十章：码头的白皇后

Port of Rio de Janeiro. Warehouse 14.

里约热内卢港。14号仓库。

The air was thick with the smell of diesel, rotting seaweed, and money. Massive cranes moved overhead like prehistoric beasts, stacking containers into steel mountains.

空气中弥漫着柴油、腐烂海藻和金钱的味道。巨大的起重机像史前巨兽一样在头顶移动，把集装箱堆成钢铁山脉。

Miyetsuko sat on a high velvet chair that Fantasma had dragged into the middle of the gritty warehouse. She wore a pristine white suit—sharp, tailored, with no blouse underneath. The deep V-neck revealed the dark, enticing shadow of her cleavage, a stark contrast to the industrial grime around her.

美悦子坐在一把高背天鹅绒椅子上，那是幽灵特意让人搬到这个肮脏仓库中央的。她穿着一套一尘不染的白色西装——剪裁锋利，里面没穿衬衫。深V领口暴露出她乳沟那深邃、诱人的阴影，与周围的工业污垢形成了鲜明对比。

She held a tablet, tapping it rhythmically with a manicured nail.

她拿着平板电脑，用修剪完美的指甲有节奏地敲击着屏幕。

"Container 404. Cleared. Container 512. Cleared." Her voice echoed in the cavernous space.

“404号集装箱。放行。512号集装箱。放行。”她的声音在空旷的空间里回荡。

Every time she tapped, a green light flashed on the customs server, and millions of dollars in Fantasma's contraband flowed into the city unchecked.

每一次敲击，海关服务器上都会闪过绿灯，数百万美元的幽灵走私品就这样畅通无阻地流入城市。

The drug lord's men watched her with awe and lust. To them, she was a witch who could turn red lights green.

毒枭的手下们敬畏又贪婪地看着她。对他们来说，她是个能把红灯变绿灯的女巫。

But Miyetsuko wasn't looking at them. She was looking at the man standing in the shadows behind her chair.

但美悦子没看他们。她在看站在她椅子后阴影里的那个男人。
