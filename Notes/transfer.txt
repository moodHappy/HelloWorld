A Short Trip
一次短途旅行

He took the early train because it was cheaper, not because he liked mornings.
他搭了清晨的火车，因为票价便宜，并不是因为他喜欢早起。

The platform smelled of metal and bread from a kiosk that hadn’t opened yet.
站台上有一股金属味，还夹杂着一家尚未开门的小摊飘出的面包气息。

A woman ahead of him kept checking the departure board, as if the city might change its mind.
他前面的一个女人反复查看发车牌，好像这座城市随时会改变主意。

The trip itself was uneventful.
旅途本身没发生什么事。

Fields slid by.
田野从窗外掠过。

A river appeared twice, then disappeared for good.

He read three pages of a paperback and gave up.

At the small station, no taxis waited.

He walked.

The hotel clerk handed him a key without asking for ID.

Room 214 faced a parking lot and a single tree wrapped in lights left over from winter.
214号房对着停车场，窗外只有一棵树，还缠着冬天没拆下来的灯串。

He dropped his bag, washed his hands, and went out again.
他放下行李，洗了手，又出门了。

In the afternoon he sat in a café near the square.
下午，他坐在广场附近的一家咖啡馆里。

A man at the next table argued on the phone in a language he half-recognized.
隔壁桌的男人用一种他似懂非懂的语言在电话里争吵。

When the call ended, the man smiled apologetically and paid for both coffees.
电话结束后，那男人带着歉意笑了笑，把两杯咖啡的钱都付了。

They did not speak.
他们没有交谈。

That evening it rained.
那天傍晚下起了雨。

He ate soup, watched people hurry past, and wrote a postcard he never sent.
他喝着汤，看人们匆匆走过，写了一张却始终没寄出的明信片。

The next morning, he checked out early.
第二天一早，他就退了房。

On the train home, he noticed mud on his shoes and tried to remember where it came from.
回程的火车上，他注意到鞋上的泥渍，试着回想它是从哪里沾上的。
