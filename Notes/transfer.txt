Chapter 9: The Necessary Mark

第九章：必要的印记

Chen Mo understood. He felt a chill, followed by an indescribable anger.

陈默听懂了。他感到一阵恶寒，紧接着是一股难以言喻的愤怒。

"So, I am the 'toy' you deliberately exposed to him? My safety relies on him thinking I am just your gigolo?"

“所以，我是你故意暴露给他的‘玩具’？我的安全，建立在他认为我只是你的小白脸之上？”

"Exactly. The filthier our relationship looks, the safer you are."

“没错。我们的关系看起来越肮脏，你就越安全。”

Miyetsuko walked up to Chen Mo. This time, she didn't give him a chance to retreat. She grabbed his tie and pulled him violently towards her.

美悦子走到陈默面前。这一次，她没有给他后退的机会。她一把揪住他的领带，猛地将他拉向自己。

"Since we are acting, we have to make it look real. When you walk out of this door later, you must look like you've been 'ravaged' by me."

“既然是演戏，就要演全套。待会儿你走出这扇门的时候，必须看起来像是被我‘蹂躏’过的样子。”

"What are you doing—"

“你要干什——”

Before Chen Mo could finish, he was shoved onto the sofa by her surprising strength. Immediately after, a fragrant, soft mountain pressed down on him.

陈默话没说完，就被她惊人的力气推倒在沙发上。紧接着，一座香软的大山压了下来。

She straddled his lap. The fabric of her dress was thin, and he could clearly feel the terrifying heat and amazing elasticity between her legs. It was a mature female body that had reached its peak ripeness—heavy, soft, and moist.

她跨坐在他的腿上。裙子的布料很薄，他能清晰地感觉到她双腿间那可怕的热度和惊人的弹性。那是一具成熟到了极致的女性躯体——沉重、柔软、湿润。

"Don't move," she ordered, her voice hoarse. "I need to leave a mark on you. A mark that his hunting dogs can smell."

“别动。”她命令道，声音沙哑，“我得在你身上留点记号。留点让他的猎犬能闻到的味道。”

She lowered her head and bit hard onto Chen Mo's neck.

她低下头，狠狠地咬在了陈默的脖颈上。

It wasn't a gentle kiss, but a bite that brought a sting of pain. Her lips sucked forcefully on his skin, while her hands were not idle. She unbuttoned Chen Mo's shirt, her plump palms roaming over his chest, seemingly checking the quality of the "goods," but also igniting fires everywhere.

那不是温柔的亲吻，而是带着刺痛的啃噬。她的嘴唇用力吸吮着他的皮肤，双手也没有闲着。她解开了陈默的衬衫，丰腴的手掌在他的胸膛上游走，像是在查验“货物”的成色，又像是在四处点火。

"Ugh..." Chen Mo let out a muffled groan. The pain on his neck mixed with the overwhelming touch of her chest pressing against his face made his brain short-circuit.

“唔……”陈默发出一声闷哼。脖子上的痛感，混合着她胸口那两团软肉死死抵在他脸上的窒息感，让他的大脑一片空白。

She deliberately pressed down hard. That unparalleled softness changed shape against his chest, squeezing out a deeply alluring cleavage line, encompassing his vision, his smell, and his touch.

她故意用力下压。那无与伦比的柔软在他的胸口挤压变形，挤出一道深邃诱人的沟壑，包围了他的视觉、嗅觉和触觉。

"That's it... smell like me," she whispered in his ear, her breath hot like magma. "Let them smell my perfume, my saliva, and the smell of my... arousal on you."

“就是这样……染上我的味道。”她在依然耳边低语，气息热得像岩浆。“让他们在你身上闻到我的香水味，我的口水味，还有我……发情的味道。”
