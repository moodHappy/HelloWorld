The old electric fan had served the family faithfully for fifteen years. Its rhythmic hum was the soundtrack to summer afternoons and sleepless nights. When temperatures soared, Grandma would position it near her rocking chair, closing her eyes as the breeze caressed her wrinkled face. One August day, it sputtered and died. Though they bought a modern replacement, something was missing. The new fan was silent and efficient, but lacked the character of its predecessor. Sometimes, on hot evenings, Grandma would still glance at the corner where her old friend once stood, remembering simpler times.
