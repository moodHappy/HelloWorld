Threads of Memory

Maya could glimpse the memories of others. A single touch was enough—suddenly shards of first love, fleeting echoes of childhood laughter, and the shadows of unspeakable losses would pour into her mind. It was a gift wrapped in burden, beauty bound with sorrow.

One afternoon, she brushed against an elderly man in the park. In an instant, she saw battlefields trembling with fear, the trembling hands of a proposal, the fragile cries of newborn children. The weight of his years pressed against her heart until tears blurred her vision.

"Are you all right?" the man asked gently. Maya could only nod, unable to explain that she had walked his entire life in the span of a breath.

As she stepped back, she realized her ability was never about memories alone—it was about the hidden filaments of fate, delicate yet unbreakable, that weave every human story into a single tapestry. To touch another was to know them, and to know them was to understand that no life is ever truly separate from the rest.
