The Lost Key
Mia had always been curious, especially about the old house at the end of her street. One afternoon, while walking home from school, she noticed something shining in the grass. It was a small, silver key with a heart-shaped top. She picked it up and immediately wondered what it could open.
That evening, Mia returned to the old house. The door was locked, but a tiny wooden box sat on the porch. The key fit perfectly. Inside the box, she found a faded note that read: “Follow the light where shadows dance.”
Confused but excited, Mia looked around. As the sun set, the branches of a nearby tree cast moving shadows across the garden. She followed them to a stone path she had never noticed before. At the end of the path was a second box. Inside it was another note: “You are braver than you think.” Nothing else.
Although there was no treasure, Mia felt a warm sense of confidence. Someone had created this tiny adventure long ago, and somehow it had reached her at the perfect moment.
