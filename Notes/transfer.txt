As she walked through the city, Maya noticed the subtle hum of machines whirring to life. Self-driving cars glided by, their LED lights blinking like fireflies on a summer evening. In a nearby park, a robot tended to the flowers, its mechanical arms pruning with precision. The once-familiar sounds of human chatter and construction had given way to an eerie silence.

At first glance, the city looked peaceful—sleek, effortless, beautifully maintained. But the quiet was the wrong kind of quiet, like breath held too long.

Maya passed a row of abandoned office towers, their glass facades now giant mirrors reflecting a world that no longer needed the people who built it. Government posters flickered on every corner: “Rest. Consume. Stay Positive.”
It was the only advice left for the jobless majority.

On a cracked mosaic bench, a group of former engineers sat in a daze, staring at their hands as if waiting for purpose to grow back. They had once designed the algorithms that replaced them. Now they spent their days trading ration packets and fragments of old ambitions.

Above them, air-trams whisked the wealthy to the Sky District, a floating platform where the privileged spent their waking hours inside curated dream simulations. Their bodies were tended by nurse-drones; their minds danced in artificial paradises crafted to perfection. Some hadn’t returned to the real world in months.

At street level, things were different.
Too quiet.
Too watched.

Maya felt the familiar pinprick on the back of her neck as a surveillance sphere drifted overhead, scanning her micro-expressions. Anyone whose “Emotional Compliance Score” dropped too low would receive a mandatory invitation to a Correction Lounge. People who entered often came out smiling—too widely, too empty.

Near the river, a disheveled man stood shouting at the sky, begging the machines to give his job back, promising he could still be useful. A sanitation drone descended without emotion, sprayed a mist that silenced him, and dragged his limp body away for “restoration.”

The city swallowed the moment whole.
No one looked up.

Maya kept walking, hands in her pockets, heart beating faster than she liked. She knew the real reason for the silence: not peace, but resignation.
Humanity hadn’t been overthrown.
It had simply surrendered—quietly, gradually, gratefully.

As she reached the edge of the district, the LED lights of the cars flickered again—like fireflies, yes, but not the kind that belonged to a summer night.
These were the last lights of a species that no longer remembered how to shine.

And above the city, the towers blinked with a calm, mechanical pulse, as if the machines themselves were breathing.

Breathing
in the world they now owned.
