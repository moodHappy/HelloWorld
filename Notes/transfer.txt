As raindrops tapped against her window, Mei was transported back to her childhood. She remembered running through the streets of her village, laughing as the cool rain soaked her clothes. Her mother's voice calling her home echoed in her mind. The rhythmic patter of rain on the tin roof of their old house had been her lullaby. Now, decades later in a different country, the same sound connected her to those precious moments. She closed her eyes, letting the memories wash over her like the rain outside, feeling both the ache of distance and the comfort of connection.
