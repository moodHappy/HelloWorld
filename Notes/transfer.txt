Chapter 2: The Woman in the Lounge

第二章：休息区的那个女人

The lounge was dim, lit only by the faint hum of a vending machine. In the corner, a woman sat in a massage chair.

休息区很昏暗，只有一台自动贩卖机发出微弱的嗡嗡声。角落的按摩椅上坐着一个女人。

She seemed to have just come from the bath, her face flushed from the steam. She wore the inn’s standard yukata, but the simple cotton garment clung to her in a way that was astonishing.

她似乎刚泡完澡，脸上带着被热气蒸腾后的红晕。她穿着旅馆统一提供的浴衣，但这件素色的棉布衣服穿在她身上，却显出一种惊心动魄的张力。

Chen Mo froze for a moment.

陈默不由得愣了一下。

It was a striking, mature charm. The neckline of her yukata was slightly open, revealing smooth skin and delicate collarbones. Her waist was cinched tightly, accentuating the full curve of her chest—a ripe, heavy fullness, not youthful firmness. As she reached for her water, the soft sway of her curves under the cloth carried a gentle, yet imposing presence.

那是一种极具冲击力的成熟风韵。浴衣的领口微敞，露出一片雪腻的肌肤和精致的锁骨，而腰带束得很紧，愈发衬托出她胸前那令人无法忽视的丰满弧度。那不是少女青涩的挺拔，而是一种熟透了的、沉甸甸的果实般的坠感，随着她起身拿水的动作，那柔软的曲线在布料下轻轻晃动，带着一种温婉却致命的压迫感。

She noticed his gaze and turned to him.

她察觉到了陈默的视线，转过头来。

“Good evening,” she said, her voice husky but warm, like silk soaked in rain.

“晚上好。”她的声音有些沙哑，却很温润，像是被雨水浸泡过的丝绸。

“G-Good evening,” Chen Mo stammered, gripping his milk can nervously, averting his eyes from the shadowed depth at her neckline. “Still awake so late?”

“晚……晚上好。”陈默有些慌乱地握紧了手里的牛奶，眼神不自然地从她领口那深邃的阴影处移开，“这么晚了，还没休息？”

“I can’t sleep,” she smiled faintly. The fine lines at the corner of her eyes didn’t age her; they added to her allure. “Home is too noisy. Finally coming out for some peace feels... strange.”

“睡不着。”女人淡淡地笑了笑，眼角的细纹不仅没有显老，反而增添了几分风情，“家里的事情太吵了，好不容易出来透口气，反而觉得安静得有些不习惯。”

A silver ring gleamed on her left ring finger in the dim light.

她左手无名指上，一枚素银戒指在昏暗的灯光下闪着微光。
