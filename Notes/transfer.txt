Chapter 57: The Handshake

第五十七章：握手

Mishima recovered quickly. He was a shark, after all.

三岛恢复得很快。毕竟他是条鲨鱼。

"Mrs. Kurosaki," he forced a smile, stepping down from the stage. "What a... pleasant surprise. We thought you were in Rio."

“黑崎夫人，”他挤出一个笑，走下舞台。“真是……惊喜。我们以为你在里约。”

"I was," she smiled back. She extended her hand. She wasn't wearing gloves.

“我是在那儿，”她回以微笑。她伸出手。没戴手套。

Mishima took her hand. He expected it to be cold. But it was warm. Alive.

三岛握住她的手。他以为会是冰冷的。但它是温暖的。鲜活的。

He leaned in close, for a hug that looked friendly to the cameras but was a threat.

他凑近，给了一个在镜头前看起来友好但实则是威胁的拥抱。

"You survived The Butcher," he whispered in her ear. "Impressive. But you are in Tokyo now. My city."

“你在屠夫手里活下来了，”他在她耳边低语。“令人印象深刻。但你现在在东京。我的城市。”

"Your city?" Miyetsuko whispered back, her hand resting lightly on his chest, right over his heart. "I brought the jungle with me, Mishima. Check your stock price."

“你的城市？”美悦子低语回去，手轻轻放在他胸口，就在心脏的位置。“我把丛林带回来了，三岛。看看你的股价。”

She pulled away, smiling for the cameras.

她推开他，对着镜头微笑。

"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a board meeting to crash. My assistant, Mr. Chen, has the paperwork."

“现在，失陪了，我有个董事会要砸场子。我的助理，陈先生，拿着文件。”

She turned and walked away.

她转身离开。

Chen Mo stepped forward. He didn't smile. He stared at Mishima with dead eyes, dropped a heavy file onto the podium, and followed his Queen.

陈默走上前。没笑。他用死寂的眼神盯着三岛，把一份厚厚的文件扔在讲台上，然后跟随他的女王离开。

As they walked out, Mishima looked at his phone.

当他们走出去时，三岛看了一眼手机。

His face went pale.

他的脸白了。
