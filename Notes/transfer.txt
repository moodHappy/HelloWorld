New Pajamas

新睡衣

“Do you like my new pajamas?” she asked, standing in the doorway.

“你喜欢我的新睡衣吗？”她站在门口问。

They were cotton, light blue, still creased from the package.

那是一套棉质的，浅蓝色，还带着刚拆封的折痕。

The room smelled of detergent and warm water from the shower.

房间里有洗衣液的味道，还有洗完澡留下的热气。

He looked up from his phone, took a second longer than necessary.

他从手机上抬头，刻意慢了半拍。

“They look comfortable,” he said.

“看起来很舒服。”他说。

She walked in, bare feet on the wooden floor, the fabric brushing softly at her knees.

她走进来，光脚踩在木地板上，布料轻轻扫过膝盖。

“I didn’t buy them for looks,” she said. “I bought them so I could sleep.”

“我不是为了好看买的。”她说，“我是为了睡觉。”

He nodded. That made sense. She’d been waking up at three for weeks.

他点点头，这很合理。她已经连续几周凌晨三点醒来。

She sat on the edge of the bed and pulled at the sleeve, testing the seam.

她坐在床边，拉了拉袖口，检查走线。

“The old ones scratched my neck,” she said.

“旧的那套磨脖子。”她说。

He reached out, touched the fabric between his fingers. It was thin, clean, cool.

他伸手捏了捏布料，薄，干净，还有点凉。

“Better?” he asked.

“好点了吗？”他问。

“Yeah,” she said. “At least tonight.”

“嗯。”她说，“至少今晚是。”

She lay back, turned off the lamp. The room fell into a dull yellow from the streetlight outside.

她躺下，关了灯。窗外路灯的暗黄色漫进来。

In the dark, she said again, quieter this time, “You really think they’re okay?”

黑暗里，她又问了一次，声音低了些：“你真的觉得还行吗？”

“They’re fine,” he said. “If you can sleep, they’re perfect.”

“挺好的。”他说，“你能睡着，就够了。”

She didn’t answer. After a while, her breathing evened out.

她没再说话。过了一会儿，她的呼吸变得平稳。

He stayed awake a little longer, listening to the fabric move when she turned.

他又醒了一会儿，听着她翻身时布料的轻响。

Tomorrow, he thought, he’d tell her they looked good too.

他想，明天再告诉她，其实也很好看。
