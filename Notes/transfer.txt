Caught Cheating

I thought I was being careful.

The exam room was silent except for pens scratching paper. I had written a few formulas on a small piece of paper and tucked it into my sleeve. I told myself I’d only look once. Just once.

Halfway through the test, my mind went blank. Panic crept in. I slowly pulled my sleeve down and glanced.

That’s when I felt it.

A shadow stopped beside my desk.

“Stand up,” the teacher said quietly.

My heart dropped. The room suddenly felt too bright. Everyone looked up.

“What’s in your sleeve?” she asked.

I tried to smile. “Nothing.”

She reached out. The paper slid onto the floor.

No one laughed. That was worse.

“Exam over,” she said. “Come with me.”

In the hallway, she didn’t yell. That made it even harder.

“Why?” she asked.

I stared at my shoes. “I didn’t study enough.”

She nodded. “That’s not a reason. That’s a choice.”

The result was simple: zero on the exam, a note sent home.

That night, I sat at my desk with my books open. Not because I had to—but because next time, I didn’t want to be afraid of a shadow.
