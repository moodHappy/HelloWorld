A Small Problem

I was already late when my phone died.

Not “low battery” dead.
Completely dead.

I stood at the bus stop, staring at the black screen, hoping it would magically turn back on.
It didn’t.

The bus arrived. I got on.

“Ticket?” the driver said.

“I—uh—my phone just died,” I said, holding it up like proof.

He looked at me. Then at the phone. Then back at me.

“That’s not my problem,” he said.

People behind me started to sigh.

“I’ll pay when I get off,” I said.
“I promise.”

He shook his head. “Rules are rules.”

For a second, I thought I’d have to get off and walk thirty minutes to work.

Then a woman behind me tapped my shoulder.

“I’ve got it,” she said, already handing him her card.

“Thank you,” I said, a little embarrassed.

She smiled. “Happens to everyone.”

I sat down, finally breathing again.

Two stops later, the bus stopped suddenly.

Traffic. Of course.

I checked the time on the screen above the driver.

Late. Still late.

When I finally ran into the office, my boss looked up.

“Rough morning?” he asked.

I nodded. “You have no idea.”

He smiled. “Coffee’s still hot.”

And just like that, the day didn’t feel so bad anymore.
