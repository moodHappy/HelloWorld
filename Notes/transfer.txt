The Raja Ampat archipelago in Indonesia, known as the 'Amazon of the Seas', is facing a serious threat from nickel mining. This area is home to some of the most diverse marine biodiversity on Earth, with colorful coral reefs and many species of fish.
Nickel is an important metal used in making batteries for electric vehicles and stainless steel. The demand for nickel has led to increased mining activities on these islands. However, this mining is causing significant damage to the environment.
Recent drone images show how mining has stripped forests and polluted waters around the islands. The Indonesian government has responded by revoking permits for four out of five mining companies in the region. This decision was welcomed by environmental campaigners, but some worry that legal action by the companies could reverse it.
While the government's action is a positive step for conservation, it highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing economic development with environmental protection.
