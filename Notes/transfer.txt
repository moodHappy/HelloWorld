The villagers whispered of the "Star-Spawn" that emerged from the old well during the new moon. Its form defied descriptionâ€”shifting between tentacles, wings, and eyes that shouldn't exist. Father Michael claimed it was an angel, but those who glimpsed it went mad, scribbling equations of non-Euclidean geometry before tearing out their own eyes. Last night, I heard it singing in tongues that vibrated my teeth. The stars are right again, and I understand now. We are but cattle for ancient hungers that slumber between dimensions. The magic they wield isn't for mortals, and we were never meant to witness their return.
