Chapter 37: The Echo of High Heels

第三十七章：高跟鞋的回响

The warehouse was a cavernous beast of rust and corrugated iron.
The smell of sea salt, diesel, and rotting fish hung heavy in the air.

仓库是一头由铁锈与波纹铁皮构成的巨兽。
空气中弥漫着海盐、柴油与腐烂鱼类的沉重气味。

The GT-R drifted into the center of the open space.
Headlights sliced through darkness—
revealing a lone figure seated on a folding chair.

GT-R 漂移进空地中央。
车灯切开黑暗——
照亮折叠椅上的孤影。

Chen Mo killed the engine.
Silence surged back like a tidal wave,
broken only by the ticking of cooling metal.

陈默熄火。
寂静如潮水回涌，
只剩引擎冷却的嗒嗒声。

"Stay in the car until I signal,"
Miyetsuko whispered, unbuckling her seatbelt.

“等我信号再下车。”
美悦子低声解开安全带。

She stepped out.
Boots struck concrete in a steady, military rhythm.

她跨出车门。
靴底在混凝土上敲出军式节奏。

Under the headlights,
black leather swallowed the light—
while exposed pale skin reflected it sharply.

车灯下，
黑色皮革吞噬光线——
裸露的苍白皮肤却刺眼反射。

The man in the chair did not move.
But red laser dots danced across the hood.

Snipers.
At least four in the rafters.

椅中男人一动不动。
但红色激光点在引擎盖上游走。

狙击手。
至少四个。

"Mishima-san,"
she stopped ten meters away, stance calm and provocative.

“三岛先生。”
她在十米外停下，姿态自信而挑衅。

The man clapped slowly.

男人缓慢鼓掌。
