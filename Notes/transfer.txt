In a quaint little town, a group of friends, John, Lily, and Mike, shared their daily lives. One day, John decided to surprise Lily for her birthday. He prepared a cake and hid it. Mike, overhearing, switched the cake with a prank one. When Lily arrived, John lit the candles, and as she blew them out, the cake exploded with confetti. Everyone burst into laughter, even Lily. Their day turned into a hilarious memory, a testament to their enduring friendship and the joy found in life's simple, silly moments.
