Chapter 18: White Fog and Black Guns

第十八章：白雾与黑枪

HISS—!!!

嘶——！！！

Dozens of nozzles on the ceiling instantly sprayed high-pressure liquid nitrogen. The temperature in the server room dropped to minus 20 degrees in seconds. A thick, white fog instantly swallowed everything, reducing visibility to zero.

天花板上几十个喷头瞬间喷出了高压液氮。机房内的温度在几秒钟内降到了零下二十度。浓密的白雾瞬间吞没了一切，能见度降为零。

"Intruder in Sector A! Fire at will!"

“A区发现入侵者！自由开火！”

The metal door was blasted open from the outside. Three tactical team members wearing gas masks rushed in. The red lasers of their guns cut through the white fog, looking like the eyes of demons.

金属门被从外面炸开。三名戴着防毒面具的战术小队成员冲了进来。枪口的红色激光束刺破白雾，像恶魔的眼睛。

Bang! Bang! Bang!

砰！砰！砰！

Bullets sparked against the server racks.

子弹打在服务器机柜上，火花四溅。

Chen Mo curled up on top of a server cabinet, his body trembling uncontrollably from the cold. He held his breath, watching the laser beams sweep under his feet. The liquid nitrogen fog perfectly masked his body heat, rendering the enemy's thermal imaging useless.

陈默蜷缩在一个服务器机柜的顶部，身体因为极寒而止不住地颤抖。他屏住呼吸，看着激光束在他脚下扫过。液氮的白雾完美掩盖了他的体温，让敌人的热成像仪失效了。

He was gambling. Gambling that they wouldn't look up.

他在赌。赌他们不会抬头。

"Clear left!"

“左侧清除！”

"Clear right!"

“右侧清除！”

"The target must have escaped through the vent! Chase!"

“目标可能通过通风口逃了！追！”

The footsteps hurried away towards the rear ventilation duct.

脚步声急促地向后方的通风管道跑去。

Chen Mo waited for ten seconds. He rolled off the cabinet, his limbs stiff as wood. He didn't run to the vent; instead, he ran towards the door the guards had just blasted open.

陈默等了十秒。他从机柜上滚下来，四肢僵硬得像木头。他没有跑向通风口，而是反其道而行之，冲向了卫兵刚刚炸开的大门。

The most dangerous place is the safest place.

最危险的地方就是最安全的地方。
