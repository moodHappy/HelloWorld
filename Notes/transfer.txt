Once upon a time, in a land called Extensia, there lived an old man named Elbert. He was known for his extensive knowledge and wisdom. One day, Elbert decided to embark on an extensive journey to find the rarest flower, the "Florescence." The journey spanned miles and months, exploring the vast forests, mountains, and valleys.

Upon his return, Elbert shared his extensive experiences and stories with the villagers. He taught them about the beauty of nature and the importance of preserving it. The people learned a lot and lived a more extensive life, filled with joy and harmony.
