Chapter 4: Not an End, But an Entry

第四章：并不是结束，是入局

That night back in Tokyo, Chen Mo traced the origin of the card.

回到东京的当晚，陈默查到了那张卡片的来源。

It wasn't an ordinary membership card, but a pass to a top private club in Ginza called "The Nest." This place operated on a strict invitation-only basis, rumored to be a gray zone where Tokyo's upper class exchanged secrets and traded power for sex.

那不是普通的会员卡，而是银座一家名为“巢穴（The Nest）”的顶级私人俱乐部的通行证。这地方实行严格的会员邀请制，据说里面是东京上流社会交换秘密、进行权色交易的灰色地带。

Chen Mo looked at the black card in his hand, then at the lipstick.

陈默看着手里的黑卡，又看了看那支口红。

He realized that the "accidental encounter" that night was not accidental at all.

他意识到，那天晚上的“偶遇”，根本不是偶遇。

That plump, gentle, housewife "Mrs. Lin" who made him ecstatic was indeed using him. Did she need an alibi? Or did she need an unknowing "messenger" to smuggle something out for her?

那个丰腴、温柔、让他欲仙欲死的人妻“林女士”，确实是在利用他。她需要一个不在场证明？还是需要一个不知情的“信使”帮她带出点什么东西？

He had been treated as prey. Or rather, a pawn.

他被当成了猎物。或者说，一颗棋子。

But when he recalled the warmth of her skin that night, the soulful sensation of sinking into soft flesh unable to extricate himself, Chen Mo gritted his teeth.

但当他回想起那晚她肌肤的温度，那陷入软肉中无法自拔的销魂感，陈默咬了咬牙。

Even if it was a trap, even if she was a woman of the Kurosaki family, he wanted to see her one more time. Even if only to question her, or... to be swallowed by that gentle trap once again.

哪怕是陷阱，哪怕她是黑崎家的女人，他也想再见她一次。哪怕只是为了质问她，或者……再被那温柔的陷阱吞噬一次。

He put on his best suit, tucked the black card with the spider print into his pocket, and hailed a taxi.

他穿上了最好的西装，把那张印着蜘蛛的黑卡揣进兜里，拦下了一辆出租车。

"To Ginza."

“去银座。”

Under the night sky, Tokyo's neon lights flickered like the eyes of monsters. What Chen Mo didn't know was that the moment he swiped the card and walked into "The Nest," his originally peaceful corporate slave life had been completely shattered.

夜幕下的东京，霓虹闪烁如同怪兽的眼睛。陈默不知道的是，当他刷卡走进“巢穴”的那一刻起，原本平静的社畜生活已经彻底粉碎。

In the deepest private room of "The Nest," a surveillance screen was displaying the image of Chen Mo walking into the lobby.

在“巢穴”最深处的包厢里，监控屏幕上正显示着陈默走进大厅的画面。

A hand wearing a lace glove gently swirled a glass of red wine. The owner of that hand was leaning lazily on the sofa, her neckline cut very low, revealing a patch of dazzling white and a deep cleavage.

一只戴着蕾丝手套的手，轻轻摇晃着红酒杯。那只手的主人，正慵懒地靠在沙发上，领口开得很低，露出一片令人眩晕的雪白和深沟。

"Little boy, you really came."

“小男生，你真的来了。”

The corner of her mouth curled into a dangerous and charming smile. Her eyes flickered with the excitement of a hunter seeing prey fall into the net, and a trace of imperceptible... anticipation.

她嘴角勾起一抹危险而迷人的微笑，眼神里闪烁着猎人看到猎物落网时的兴奋，以及一丝不易察觉的……期待。
