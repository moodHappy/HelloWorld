Here's a 100-word short story in English at CEFR Level B1, inspired by the theme "悬疑与推理类" (Mystery and Reasoning) in a spoken style:

"Listen, I got a weird case. Rich guy dies, and his wife is all shaken. But here's the thing - the wife stood to gain a lot from his death. I mean, his business was tanking, and she was the beneficiary of his life insurance. Now, the detective on the case thinks it's an open-and-shut suicide, but I'm not so sure. There's something fishy. The victim's last message was 'I'm sorry', but sorry for what? Was it a guilty conscience or a clever trick? I'm gonna dig deeper. This case just got a whole lot more interesting."
