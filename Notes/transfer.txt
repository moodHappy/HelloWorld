In the misty peaks, Li built a small cottage. Days bled into weeks, then months. He rose with the sun, gathered herbs, meditated by the stream. One morning, a traveler stumbled upon his dwelling.

"What year is this?" Li asked, startled.

The traveler stared. "It's 2023. You've been gone fifteen years."

Li frowned. "Fifteen years? But it feels like mere months."

In the mountains, time had dissolved like morning dew. The seasons changed, yet remained the same. The mountains had taught him eternityâ€”not as endless duration, but as the present moment, stretching infinitely in all directions. Here, he had finally found timelessness.
