# The Unlikely Roommate

My pet dragon, Smoky, had set the curtains on fire... again. "I was just trying to toast a marshmallow!" he protested with soot around his mouth. I handed him the fire extinguisher. "For the fifth time, dragons don't live in apartments!"

Meanwhile, the unicorn was using its horn to connect to the Wi-Fi, complaining about buffering speeds. "This forest has terrible internet," he whined dramatically. And the grumpy garden gnome demanded cryptocurrency for posing with tourists.

Magic creatures and modern livingâ€”a chaotic mix that somehow works. Mostly.
