# Small but Certain Happiness

The morning sun painted streaks of gold across the kitchen table as Li Hua savored her steaming cup of jasmine tea. Outside, a sparrow hopped across the windowsill, its tiny movements bringing a smile to her lips. These were her small but certain happinesses - the quiet moments that made life rich. She thought of the elderly neighbor who had shared homemade dumplings yesterday, and the child who had handed her a wildflower on her morning walk. Life was not about grand achievements, but about collecting these tiny treasures of joy, one by one, until they filled her heart with contentment.
