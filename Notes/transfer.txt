"Hey man, I divorced my wife," Tom said over the phone.

"For real?" Mike asked.

"Yeah, caught her cheating," Tom replied with a heavy voice.

"Don't be sad, bro. Honestly, you should've left her ages ago. I've seen her checking into hotels with different guys multiple times. You know I always try to keep relationships together, so I never said anything. What're you up to now? Wanna grab a few drinks? My treat."

There was a pause, then Tom's voice brightened. "Nah, I'm good. Just playing truth or dare with my wife right now."
