Chapter 3: The Secret of the Locker

第三章：储物柜的秘密

Chen Mo was a data guy; he had a natural sensitivity to numbers.

陈默是个搞数据的，对数字有着天生的敏感。

10-24. If it was a date, it would be next month. If it was time, it could be morning or evening. But that "L"—what if it meant "Locations"?

10-24。如果是日期，那是下个月。如果是时间，早晚都有可能。但那个“L”，如果是Locations（地点）呢？

He remembered that at the Izu station, when they parted ways, she had unintentionally stared at a row of coin lockers for a long time. He thought she was dazing off at the time.

他想起了在伊豆车站，他们分别时，她曾无意中盯着车站的一排投币储物柜看了很久。当时他以为她在发呆。

A crazy intuition drove him. Since this was a "spin-off," life should no longer play by the rules.

一种疯狂的直觉驱使着他。既然是“番外”，生活就不该再按常理出牌。

The next day happened to be the weekend, and Chen Mo took the earliest Shinkansen to Izu. He was crazy, but he couldn't control himself. His mind was full of her charming gasps in his ear that night and that icy face in the newspaper now. This huge contrast made the blood in his whole body burn.

第二天正好是周末，陈默坐上了最早一班去伊豆的新干线。他疯了，但他控制不住自己。脑海里全是她那晚在他耳边娇媚的喘息，和现在报纸上那张冷若冰霜的脸。这种巨大的反差，让他浑身的血液都在燃烧。

Back at the small Izu station. He found that row of lockers.

回到伊豆那个小车站。他找到了那排储物柜。

Locker number 10.

第10号柜子。

Chen Mo tried to guess the code with that combination of numbers, but these were old-fashioned key lockers. Was that "L" not a location?

陈默试着用那串数字组合去猜密码，但这是老式的钥匙柜。那个“L”难道不是地点？

Just as he stood dazed in front of the locker, a station janitor walked over: "Young man, that one is broken."

就在他站在柜子前发愣时，一个车站清洁工大爷走了过来：“小伙子，那是坏的。”

"Broken?"

“坏的？”

"Yeah, a noble lady was here a few days ago. That locker swallowed her coin and wouldn't open. She seemed in a hurry and left it alone. She said if someone came asking, give this to that person."

“嗯，前几天有个贵妇人，那个柜子吞了硬币打不开，她好像很急，后来就没管了。她说如果有人来问，就把这个给那个人。”

The old man took an envelope out of his pocket.

大爷从口袋里掏出一个信封。

"What kind of person did she say?" Chen Mo's voice was tight.

“她说是什么样的人？”陈默声音发紧。

"She said, a man who looks like he just had a heartbreak, or just woke up from a dream."

“她说，一个看起来像是刚失恋，或者刚从梦里醒来的男人。”

Chen Mo took the envelope. There was no letter inside, only a thin, hard magnetic card. The card was completely black with no pattern, only a dark golden spider printed on the back.

陈默接过信封，里面没有信纸，只有一张薄薄的、硬质的磁卡。卡片全黑，没有任何图案，只有背面印着一只暗金色的蜘蛛。
