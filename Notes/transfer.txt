Chapter 32: The Smoke After the Storm

第三十二章：风暴后的烟草

An hour later, the storm inside the room had faded.
Only rain remained outside the window.

一小时后，房间里的风暴平息。
只剩窗外雨声。

Chen Mo lay staring at the painted fish on the ceiling.
Miyetsuko rested on his chest, breathing steady now.

陈默盯着天花板的鱼。
美悦子趴在他胸口，呼吸渐稳。

She reached for a forgotten pack of cheap cigarettes and lit one.

她摸到床头遗留的廉价香烟，点燃。

"This tastes terrible…
but better than nothing."

“味道真差……
但聊胜于无。”

"We have the data," Chen Mo said quietly.
"But the police path is blocked."

“数据在手。
但报警的路被堵死了。”

"In Tokyo, justice has a price tag."
Her eyes sharpened through the smoke.
"We sell it to someone who pays more."

“在东京，正义有标价。”
她隔着烟雾看他，目光重新锋利。
“卖给出价更高的人。”

"The Mishima Group."

“三岛财团。”

The name froze the air.

空气凝固。
