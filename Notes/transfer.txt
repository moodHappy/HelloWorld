Tom rushed into the coffee shop, desperate for caffeine. "I'll have a large black coffee, please!" he exclaimed to the barista.

The young employee nodded, then whispered to his colleague, "That guy wants the 'black coffee' special."

Tom waited nervously as they prepared an elaborate drink with black syrup, cocoa powder, and whipped cream.

"Here's your black coffee!" the barista proudly presented the concoction.

Tom stared at the mountain of sweets. "I just wanted regular black coffee..."

The shop erupted in laughter. From that day, Tom always specified "no funny business" with his order.
