Chapter 1: The Remaining Red

第一章：残留的红

Seven days after returning to Tokyo, Chen Mo felt like he had lost half his soul.

回到东京的第七天，陈默觉得自己的魂丢了一半。

The smell of sweat in the crowded subway and the ozone scent from the office printers made him nauseous. His senses had been thoroughly "spoiled" by that rainy night. Whenever he closed his eyes, his fingertips didn't feel the cold keyboard, but that warm, heavy, voluptuous touch like a fully ripened peach—something absolutely untouchable in this bustling city.

那种拥挤地铁里的汗臭味、办公室打印机的臭氧味，让他无比反胃。他的感官仿佛被那个雨夜彻底“养刁”了。只要一闭上眼，指尖触碰到的不是冰凉的键盘，而是那晚在这个繁华都市绝对触摸不到的——那种温热、沉甸甸、如同熟透蜜桃般的丰腴触感。

That fleshiness wasn't the looseness of obesity, but a "charming flesh" that had been meticulously maintained and was full of elasticity. Especially when she leaned over, the heat wave carrying the scent of milk spiraled in his brain like a drug addiction.

那种肉感不是松弛的肥胖，而是被精细保养出来的、富有弹性的“媚肉”。特别是当她俯身时，那股带着乳香的热浪，简直像毒瘾一样在他脑子里盘旋。

Working late that day, Chen Mo wearily rummaged through the pockets of the windbreaker he had brought back from Izu.

那天加班到深夜，陈默疲惫地翻找那件从伊豆带回来的冲锋衣口袋。

His fingertips touched a cold metal cylinder.

指尖触碰到了一个冰凉的金属圆管。

That was the jacket he wore at the inn. He pulled it out and looked at it; his heart skipped a beat instantly.

那是他在旅馆穿的那件外套。他掏出来一看，心跳瞬间漏了半拍。

It was a lipstick.

那是一支口红。

A black and gold tube, heavy in texture, with the logo of an unfamiliar luxury brand engraved on the bottom. He remembered clearly that on the morning he left, he had checked all his pockets, and this thing was definitely not there.

黑金配色的管身，沉甸甸的质感，底部刻着一个陌生的奢侈品牌Logo。他记得很清楚，离开那天早上，他检查过所有口袋，里面绝对没有这个东西。

Did she leave this on purpose?

这是她故意留下的？

Chen Mo pulled off the cap to reveal an extremely vivid "Royal Red." He smelled it as if possessed; it was her scent—a mix of expensive spices and that faint fragrance that drove men mad.

陈默拔开盖子，是一抹极其艳丽的“正宫红”。他鬼使神差地凑近闻了闻，那是她身上的味道——混合着昂贵香料和那股让男人发狂的、淡淡的幽香。

Suddenly, he noticed that the lipstick paste was not fully twisted down. He gently turned the base, raising the lipstick. On the side of the red paste, a few tiny numbers seemed to be carved.

突然，他发现口红的膏体并没有完全旋到底。他轻轻转动底部，口红升起，在红色的膏体侧面，竟然似乎刻着几个极小极小的数字。

You couldn't see them without looking closely, as if they were carved by the tip of a needle: 10-24-L.

不仔细看根本发现不了，像是用某种针尖刻上去的：10-24-L。
