Chapter 34: The Gunpowder in the Ramen Bowl

第三十四章：拉面碗里的火药

3:00 AM. Kabukicho.
The rain had turned into a drizzle, mixing with the neon lights to create a psychedelic oil painting on the asphalt.

凌晨3点。歌舞伎町。
雨变成了毛毛细雨，混合着霓虹灯光，在沥青路上晕染出一幅迷幻的油画。

They walked into a rundown ramen shop in a back alley.
The shop was empty except for an old man with a prosthetic eye wiping the counter.

他们走进后巷一家破旧的拉面店。
店里空无一人，只有一个戴着义眼的老头在擦柜台。

"Two bowls of tonkotsu. Extra garlic."
Miyetsuko sat on the stool, her wet hair still dripping.
She looked like a fallen angel—beautiful and dangerous.

“两碗豚骨。多加蒜。”
美悦子坐在圆凳上，湿发还在滴水。
她像个堕落天使，美丽而危险。

"And two side dishes.
The spicy kind."

“还有两份**‘配菜’**。
要辣的那种。”

She placed a stack of soaked banknotes on the counter.

她把一叠湿透的钞票拍在柜台上。

The old man's one good eye scanned her, then landed on Chen Mo.
He grunted, reached under the counter, and pulled out a greasy oil-paper package—
dropping it into the empty ramen bowl.

老头的独眼扫过她，又落在陈默身上。
他哼了一声，从柜台下掏出一个油腻的油纸包——
扔进空拉面碗里。

Chen Mo unwrapped it.

Inside:
two Glock 19s.
Four magazines.
Serial numbers filed off.

陈默打开油纸包。

里面是——
两把格洛克19。
四个弹夹。
序列号全部磨掉。

"Cold War leftovers," the old man said, pouring broth.
"But they still work."

“冷战时期的旧货，”老头一边倒汤一边说。
“但依然好用。”

Miyetsuko picked up a gun.
She racked the slide with fluid precision.

Click. Clack.

美悦子拿起手枪。
动作流畅而熟练。

咔哒。

"You know how to use it?"

“你会用？”

"My father was Yakuza before going legit," she said lazily,
aiming at a cockroach on the wall.

"I learned to shoot before I learned piano."

“我父亲洗白前是极道大哥。”
她懒散地瞄准墙上的蟑螂。

“我在学钢琴前，先学会开枪。”

She set the gun down and began eating.
Steam blurred her face—
but not the killing intent in her eyes.

她放下枪，开始吃面。
热气模糊了她的脸——
却遮不住眼里的杀意。
