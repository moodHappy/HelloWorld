# A Little Historical Story

You know, paper was invented in China around 105 AD by a guy named Cai Lun. Before that, people wrote on bamboo strips or silk, which was super expensive! Can you imagine carrying around a library of bamboo? Cai mixed tree bark, hemp, rags, and even fishing nets to create the first real paper. At first, the emperor wasn't impressed, but when officials realized how much cheaper and easier it was, paper production spread like wildfire. Within a few centuries, this Chinese invention traveled along the Silk Road and changed how the whole world shared information. Pretty cool, right?
