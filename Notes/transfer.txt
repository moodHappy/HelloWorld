Mark, 3B

Mark had learned to keep his life light.
Tools he could carry himself. Furniture that came apart easily. Conversations that ended before they required explanations.

Apartment 3B wasn’t special. One bedroom, uneven heating, a window that faced another building’s brick wall. But it was close to the station, and that mattered. Most of his work clustered there—old hotels, aging apartments, places that needed constant attention but never real renovation. Temporary fixes for permanent problems.

He worked maintenance for three property owners who didn’t talk to each other but somehow shared the same priorities: fast, cheap, quiet. Pipes, locks, loose hinges, lights that flickered just enough to annoy but not enough to report—until they did.

He liked buildings. They told the truth eventually. You could trace a leak, follow a sound, see where someone had cut corners years ago and hoped no one would notice. People were harder. They hid damage until it spread.

Most mornings, Mark stopped at a café near the station. The coffee was bad. Burnt, thin, overpriced. He drank it anyway, standing by the counter, watching travelers with suitcases and faces set toward somewhere else. The café felt like a waiting room for lives that hadn’t decided where to land.

That was where he first noticed how many people lived temporarily without admitting it.

The woman from 4A—Lena—had moved in before him. He knew her only in pieces: quiet footsteps above his ceiling, plants visible through her window, a habit of carrying groceries in reusable bags even when it rained. She said little, but when she did, it was precise. He respected that.

The week her sister stayed over, Mark noticed the change without trying. Extra footsteps on the stairs. Laughter, brief and cautious. A different rhythm in the building. Temporary always made noise, even when it tried not to.

He ran into Lena in the stairwell that evening, taking out the trash. She looked the same, but something about her attention felt split, as if part of it was somewhere else.

“Pipe acting up again?” he asked. It was easier than asking anything real.

“Always,” she said. “The building’s older than both of us.”

He smiled. Buildings aged honestly. People pretended.

They talked the way neighbors sometimes do—about weather, about bad coffee near the station, about nothing that would need follow-up. He liked that she didn’t ask what he fixed that day, or where he was headed next.

Later that week, he knocked on her door to return a package that wasn’t his. A man’s name on the label. Inside, he glimpsed another woman—similar enough to register as family, different enough to explain the tension he’d been sensing all week.

“You’ve got company,” he said.

“My sister. Temporarily.”

He nodded. “Temporary tends to stretch.”

She didn’t argue. That stayed with him.

Mark had once stayed somewhere temporary himself. After a job ran long near the station, he’d taken a room in a cheap hotel for convenience. Thin walls. Slow elevators. People who avoided eye contact out of mutual agreement. He remembered the relief of anonymity—and the restlessness that followed once it lasted too long.

He finished that job, moved on, didn’t look back. That was how it usually went.

When Lena’s sister left, the building settled again. Fewer footsteps. Less noise. But something didn’t fully return to its old place. Mark noticed Lena watering her plants later than usual one evening, standing by the window longer than before.

On Saturday, he saw her outside as he locked his bike. She looked like someone deciding whether to go somewhere unnecessary.

“You ever go to that café?” he asked. “The one by the station.”

She said she had. Said it wasn’t great.

“That’s what I hear,” he said. “Still. Sometimes bad coffee is better than none.”

She looked at him then, really looked, and said, “I suppose it depends what you’re avoiding.”

He hadn’t expected that. He smiled anyway. “Or what you’re waiting for.”

They went their separate ways. No numbers exchanged. No plan made. Mark preferred it that way. Possibility was lighter when you didn’t force it to land.

That afternoon, he worked a short job near the station—replacing a loose lock in a hotel hallway. Guests passed him with suitcases, phones pressed to their ears, faces already elsewhere. Someone asked how long the noise would last. He said, “Not long.”

It was true, in more ways than one.

That evening, back in 3B, Mark cleaned his tools and set them neatly by the door. Outside, trains came and went. Above him, Lena’s apartment went dark, one room at a time.

Mark didn’t think of his life as unfinished. Just adjustable. Like a hinge that needed tightening now and then. Like a door that didn’t quite close unless you learned the trick of it.

Temporary, he knew, wasn’t the opposite of permanent.
It was just a way of keeping the door unlocked, in case something—or someone—decided to stay.
