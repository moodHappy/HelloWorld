Nasal Congestion

鼻塞

He woke up before the alarm because he could not breathe through his nose.

他在闹钟响之前醒了，因为鼻子不通气。

The room smelled faintly of dust and last night’s rain drifting in through the cracked window.

房间里有一股淡淡的灰尘味，还有昨晚雨水从窗缝里带进来的潮气。

He lay still, testing each nostril like checking two doors.

他躺着不动，像检查两扇门一样试着用左右鼻孔呼吸。

The left one worked a little.
The right one was completely blocked.

左边还能勉强通气。
右边彻底堵死了。

He rolled onto his side. The blockage shifted, not gone, just relocated.

他翻了个身，堵塞感跟着移动了位置，没有消失，只是换了地方。

That annoyed him more than if it had stayed the same.

这反而更让他烦躁。

He thought of calling in sick, but it felt dishonest. His body was uncomfortable, not ill.

他想过请病假，但又觉得不太对。他只是难受，不是真的生病。

In the bathroom mirror, his face looked normal. Slightly swollen eyes. A red nose tip.

浴室镜子里的脸看起来很正常。眼睛有点肿，鼻尖发红。

Nothing dramatic enough to explain anything to anyone.

不足以向任何人解释什么。

He boiled water and leaned over the steam. The warmth softened his face, fogged his glasses.

他烧了热水，低头对着蒸汽。热气让脸放松下来，眼镜起了雾。

For a few seconds, air flowed freely.

有那么几秒钟，空气顺畅地进出。

Then it closed again, quietly, without asking.

随后又悄悄堵上了，没有征求他的意见。

On the bus, he breathed through his mouth. His throat dried out.

在公交车上，他只能用嘴呼吸，喉咙很快干了。

A woman next to him sniffed once and moved her bag closer.

旁边的女人吸了下鼻子，把包往自己这边挪了挪。

He wanted to say it was just nasal congestion, nothing contagious.

他想解释只是鼻塞，不传染。

He said nothing.

他什么也没说。

At work, words came out slightly wrong. Not incorrect, just heavier.

在工作中，说出口的话有点变形。不是错了，只是变得沉重。

He noticed people waited an extra beat before replying.

他发现别人回答前，总会多停顿一拍。

By noon, the pressure behind his eyes grew dull and steady.

中午时分，眼眶后的压力变得迟钝而持续。

He pressed the bridge of his nose with two fingers.

他用两根手指按着鼻梁。

The relief was minimal but convincing enough to repeat.

缓解很轻微，但足以让他反复去按。

He ate soup for lunch. Hot, salty, bland.

午饭他喝了汤，热的，咸的，很淡。

Steam rose again. Another brief opening.

蒸汽再次升起，又是一次短暂的通畅。

He closed his eyes and stayed there longer than necessary.

他闭着眼，多停留了一会儿。

In the afternoon, the congestion settled in as if it had decided to stay.

下午，鼻塞像是下定了决心，不打算走了。

He stopped fighting it.

他不再试图对抗。

On the way home, he bought tissues, nasal spray, and nothing else.

回家路上，他买了纸巾、喷鼻剂，别的什么都没买。

At night, lying in bed, he breathed carefully, slowly.

夜里躺在床上，他小心而缓慢地呼吸。

One nostril open. One closed.

一边通，一边堵。

He accepted the imbalance.

他接受了这种不对称。

Sleep came unevenly, but it came.

睡眠来得断断续续，但还是来了。

By morning, it would probably be better.

到早上，大概会好一点。

Or not.

也可能不会。

Either way, he would get up.

不管怎样，他都会起床。
