The Shadow's Whisper

Every night, when the lamps dimmed, Ethan's shadow would detach itself from his feet. It would stretch and yawn, then begin its nightly wanderings through the sleeping town.

Ethan could see it from his window, dancing with other shadows in the moonlight. They communicated in silent gestures, sharing secrets only darkness could tell. Some nights, they would gather in the park, forming intricate patterns that vanished by dawn.

One evening, his shadow left a note on his pillow: "We're more than just absences of light. We're memories, dreams, and possibilities."

Ethan smiled. He'd always known his shadow was special. Now he understood why.
