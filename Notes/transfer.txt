# Future World

In 2089, everyone wore the "Happiness Band" that broadcast their emotions. The algorithm ensured we only saw content that kept us "balanced." Sarah's band glowed red - she'd seen something that broke the system. "Ignorance is bliss," the ads proclaimed, but curiosity killed the cat. She'd discovered the truth: the bands didn't just monitor emotions - they manufactured them. The powers that be were pulling strings like puppet masters. When the authorities came for her, Sarah smiled. She'd already planted the virus. As the bands failed worldwide, people saw reality for the first time. You can't put the genie back in the bottle.
