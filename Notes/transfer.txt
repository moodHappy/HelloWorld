Mark had just celebrated his 40th birthday when his colleague asked, "Aren't you too old for this project?" Later that week, a younger employee called him "sir" with a mix of respect and pity. At home, his children teased him about his graying hair. He felt invisible in a world that worshipped youth. Yet when his friend suddenly passed away at 42, Mark heard the mourners whisper, "He was so young." The irony wasn't lost on himâ€”society only acknowledged his youth in death, while in life, he was merely "getting old."
