Chapter 26: The Wolf at the Door

第二十六章：门口的狼

Back in the safe house.

回到安全屋。

Chen Mo closed the laptop. "The bait is taken. I intercepted an encrypted signal from Kurosaki's HQ. He contacted the 'Cleanup Crew'."

陈默合上电脑。“鱼上钩了。我截获了黑崎总部的加密信号。他联系了‘清道夫’。”

"Good. He's panicking. When a man panics, he makes mistakes." Miyetsuko was buttoning her shirt—well, attempting to button the shirt that was too tight for her chest.

“很好。他慌了。男人一慌，就会犯错。”美悦子正在扣扣子——或者说，试图扣上那件对她胸部来说太紧的衬衫。

Suddenly, Chen Mo's expression changed. He put a finger to his lips.

突然，陈默脸色一变。他竖起手指放在嘴边。

"Shh."

“嘘。”

He pointed to the door.

他指了指门口。

On the monitor of the hidden camera in the hallway, three men dressed as gas maintenance workers were approaching their door. They carried heavy toolboxes. The way they walked—steady, silent, tactical formation—screamed "assassins."

在走廊隐蔽摄像头的监控器上，三个穿着煤气维修工制服的男人正走向他们的房门。他们提着沉重的工具箱。那种走路的方式——稳健、无声、战术队形——都在尖叫着“杀手”二字。

"They found us fast," Miyetsuko whispered, grabbing a pistol from under the sofa cushion. Her eyes weren't fearful, but excited.

“他们找得真快。”美悦子低声说，从沙发垫下摸出一把手枪。她的眼神没有恐惧，只有兴奋。

"This is one of his properties. He knows the layout." Chen Mo picked up the fruit knife again. "We have to leave. Now."

“这也是他的房产之一。他知道布局。”陈默再次拿起了水果刀。“我们得走。立刻。”

"The back window leads to the fire escape," Miyetsuko kicked off her heels, standing barefoot on the cold floor. "But we need a diversion."

“后窗通向防火梯。”美悦子踢掉高跟鞋，赤脚站在冰冷的地板上。“但我们需要一个诱饵。”

She looked at the bottle of expensive whiskey on the table, then at the microwave oven.

她看了看桌上那瓶昂贵的威士忌，又看了看微波炉。

"Chen, do you know how to make a Molotov cocktail in 10 seconds?"

“陈，你知道怎么在10秒内做一个莫洛托夫鸡尾酒吗？”

Chen Mo smiled. It was a feral smile.

陈默笑了。那是野性的笑容。

"Honey, I'm a chemist when I'm not coding."

“亲爱的，我不写代码的时候是个化学家。”
