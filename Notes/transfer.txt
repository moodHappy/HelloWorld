Chapter 11: The Secret Invitation

第十一章：秘密邀约

Lunch break was a mess of loud voices and the smell of convenience store bread. Shiraishi walked past Miyetsuko’s desk, acting like he was heading for the trash can. With a quick, practiced flick of his fingers, a small, crumpled piece of paper landed right in her lap.

午休时间，教室里充斥着吵闹声和便利店面包的味道。白石走过美悦子的课桌，假装要去扔垃圾。他手指熟练地轻轻一弹，一张揉皱的小纸条就精准地落在了她的膝盖上。

Miyetsuko didn't look up immediately. She waited for him to walk away before smoothing out the paper under the table. It was just one sentence in his messy handwriting: "Old school building. Third floor storage room. Don't be late."

美悦子没立刻抬头。她等他走远后，才在桌下悄悄把纸条抹平。上面只有一行他那潦草的字迹：“旧校舍，三楼储藏室。不许迟到。”

Her stomach did a little flip. The old school building was abandoned, full of dust and shadows—the perfect place for the kind of things they couldn't do in a crowded hallway. She felt a flush creeping up her neck, her heart beginning to thump against her ribs.

她的胃部微微抽搐了一下。旧校舍已经荒废了，到处是灰尘和阴影——正是做那些没法在人来人往的走廊里做的事的绝佳去处。她感到一阵红晕顺着脖子爬了上来，心跳开始撞击肋骨。
