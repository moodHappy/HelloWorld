Barry the office intern burst in, wielding a bright orange water gun. "Die, evil spreadsheet!" he shrieked, squirting his monitor. Brenda from Accounting gasped, clutching her pearls. "He's gone mad! Gunshot! Gunshot!" she screamed, diving under her desk. Security guard Dave arrived, panting, only to find Barry triumphantly wiping a droplet off his screen. "Mission accomplished," Barry declared. Dave sighed, pulling out a tiny notepad. "Son, that's the third 'workplace shooting' this week involving your Super Soaker. HR says next time, you're getting written up... with a damp pen." Barry just grinned, eyeing the coffee machine. "My next target brews justice."
