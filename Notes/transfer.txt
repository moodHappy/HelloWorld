Title: The Last Letter

Emily found a dusty envelope in the attic, addressed to her in handwriting she didn’t recognize. Inside was a letter from a stranger:

"If you are reading this, it means I failed to reach you in time. Life is short, but some moments are infinite. Remember the oak tree by the river. One day, you will understand."

She stared at the paper for hours, puzzled. Weeks later, walking by the river, she noticed a massive oak tree she had never seen before. Beneath its roots, a small box was buried. Inside: a locket with a tiny photograph of a smiling woman—and herself.

Some messages, she realized, are written not in ink, but in time.
