# My Daily Life

I wake up at 7 AM every day. First, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then I make breakfast - just toast and tea. I eat breakfast with my family. After that, I go to work by bus. The bus ride takes about 15 minutes. At work, I talk to customers and answer emails. I have lunch at 12:30 with my colleagues. In the evening, I cook dinner for my family. We watch TV together after eating. I go to bed at 10:30. My life is simple, but I like it!
