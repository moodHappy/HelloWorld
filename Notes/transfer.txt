Chapter 4: The Golden Chains and the Hidden Steel

第四章：金链与暗刃

"This isn't a dress. It's jewelry with intentions." Miyetsuko stood on the terrace, the Rio sunset painting her skin in shades of bronze and fire.

“这不叫裙子。这叫‘以此为名的珠宝’。”美悦子站在露台上，里约的夕阳把她的皮肤涂抹成青铜和火焰的颜色。

She was wearing a custom-made Carnival Samba outfit.

她穿着一套定制的狂欢节桑巴舞服。

There was no fabric. Only strands of gold chains and Swarovski crystals draped over her naked body. A heavy, jeweled collar covered her neck. Two waterfalls of gold chains cascaded from her shoulders, barely concealing her massive, unconfined breasts. As she moved, the chains parted and swayed, allowing glimpses of the dark, swollen aureoles underneath, teasing the eye with every breath.

没有布料。只有金链和施华洛世奇水晶串成的珠帘挂在她赤裸的身体上。一个沉重的镶钻项圈围着她的脖子。两道金链瀑布从她肩头倾泻而下，勉强遮住她那宏伟、不受束缚的乳房。随着她的动作，金链分开又摇晃，让下面深色、肿胀的乳晕若隐若现，每一次呼吸都在挑逗着视线。

Her hips were framed by a high-cut bikini bottom made entirely of gold mesh. It was transparent enough to show the shadow of her desire, but reflective enough to blind anyone who stared too long.

她的臀部被一条完全由金网制成的高开叉比基尼下装勾勒出来。它透明得足以显示她欲望的阴影，但又反光得足以晃瞎任何盯着看太久的人。

"Where is the gun?" Chen Mo asked, his throat dry. He was wearing a white linen suit, unbuttoned to the sternum, looking like a corrupt colonial prince.

“枪在哪？”陈默喉咙发干地问。他穿着一套白色亚麻西装，扣子开到胸骨，看起来像个堕落的殖民地王子。

"Here." Miyetsuko lifted her right leg.

“这儿。”美悦子抬起右腿。

She was wearing thigh-high gladiator sandals made of gold leather. Strapped to her inner thigh, high up near the warmth of her groin, was a tiny, gold-plated derringer.

她穿着金色的角斗士高筒凉鞋，一直绑到大腿。在大腿内侧，紧贴着她腹股沟热度的地方，绑着一把微型的镀金德林加手枪。

"Two shots. .45 caliber," she smiled, lowering her leg. The chains clinked softly against her skin. "I call it 'The Last Kiss'."

“两发子弹。.45口径，”她笑着放下腿。金链在她皮肤上发出轻微的撞击声。“我叫它‘最后一吻’。”

"You look like a goddess of war," Chen Mo walked over, his hand sliding over her bare hip. The metal chains felt cool, but her skin underneath was scorching hot.

“你看起来像个战争女神，”陈默走过去，手滑过她赤裸的臀部。金属链条感觉冰凉，但下面她的皮肤滚烫。

"Then let's go start a war," she leaned into his touch. "I want to dance until I bleed."

“那我们就去发动一场战争，”她迎合着他的触碰。“我想跳舞，跳到流血为止。”
