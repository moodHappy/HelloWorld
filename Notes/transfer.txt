Penthouse suite. The sun was setting, painting the room in blood orange.

顶层套房。夕阳西下，把房间染成了血橙色。

Miyetsuko stood by the window, her phone pressed to her ear. She was still wearing the silk robe, but her posture was rigid.

美悦子站在窗边，手机紧贴耳边。她还穿着那件丝绸睡袍，但姿势僵硬。

“幽灵？接电话，”她嘶声道。

Voicemail.

语音信箱。

她拨给港口经理。语音信箱。

她拨给走私贩。语音信箱。

Chen Mo was at his laptop. The screen, usually a waterfall of green transaction codes, was now a wall of static red.

“他孤立了我们，”美悦子把手机扔在沙发上。手机在皮革上弹了一下。“我们瞎了。也聋了。”

"And soon, we will be dead," Chen Mo closed the laptop. "They will hit us tonight. Here."

“很快，我们就会死，”陈默合上电脑。“他们今晚会动手。就在这儿。”

他站起身，走到衣柜前。拖出一个沉重的行李袋。

"We leave now. The safe house in Santa Teresa."

“现在就走。去圣特雷莎区的安全屋。”
