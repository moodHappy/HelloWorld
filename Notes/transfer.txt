Next Door

They checked in arguing.

Not loudly—just enough to feel it. The kind of argument that had been going on for days, maybe weeks, and no longer needed volume to stay alive.

The man walked ahead, pulling the suitcase too fast. The woman followed, arms crossed, phone clenched in her hand like evidence.

Room 615.

Inside, the room was smaller than expected. One bed. One chair. The air smelled faintly of detergent and something sweet gone stale.

“You could’ve booked a better place,” she said.

“For one night?” he replied. “It’s fine.”

“That’s what you always say. ‘It’s fine.’”

He didn’t answer. He sat on the edge of the bed and started untying his shoes, slow, deliberate. She paced near the window, pulling the curtain open, then closed again.

They had come for a wedding. His cousin’s. A city neither of them liked, spending money neither of them wanted to spend. The fight had started in the car, over directions, then drifted into everything else—work, family, old promises.

Later, they ate cold sandwiches from a convenience store. The TV was on, volume low. Neither of them watched.

“You didn’t even ask how my meeting went,” she said.

“You didn’t want to talk,” he said.

“I wanted you to ask.”

Silence.

At midnight, the argument finally broke through the walls. Not shouting—sharp whispers, words cutting close.

“I’m tired,” she said. “Of always being the one who cares.”

“I do care,” he said. “I just don’t do it the way you want.”

She laughed once, short and bitter.

“Exactly.”

He stood up, grabbed his jacket.

“Where are you going?” she asked.

“Downstairs. To get some air.”

The door closed behind him, softer than she expected.

She sat on the bed alone, scrolling through her phone without seeing anything. Ten minutes passed. Twenty.

He came back smelling like cold night air and cigarettes, even though he’d quit years ago.

They didn’t talk.

In the morning, they woke up facing opposite directions. The wedding was in three hours. They would smile in photos, raise glasses, tell people they were doing well.

As they checked out, the receptionist wished them a nice day.

They said “you too” at the same time.

For a moment, they almost laughed.

Almost.
