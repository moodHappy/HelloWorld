wuhuu!!!
holiday trip officially starting and my heart is already smiling 💛

aaand it already started with chaos 😅
security check decided I was very suspicious apparently… got checked and then the lady accidentally tickled my armpits and I legit squeaked 🙈🙈 like a startled mouse. Everyone stared. I pretended this happens to me all the time. It does not.

now heading to the gate, still laughing at myself, cheeks red, dignity slightly left behind at airport security 🤭

so excited for warmer air, fresh fruit, slow mornings and just feeling light again 😇
wishing everyone the sweetest, coziest, happiest holidays ever 🤍

laugh a lot, rest a little, and please… survive airport security with more grace than I did
