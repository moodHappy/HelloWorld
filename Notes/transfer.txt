Chapter 15: The Weekend at the Retreat

第十五章：度假村的周末

Part 1: The Glass Sanctuary

玻璃圣域

The Hakone retreat was a masterpiece of cold stone and floor-to-ceiling glass, perched precariously over a misty ravine. Inside, the air was heavy with the scent of expensive cigars and the sharp, clinical smell of gin.

箱根的度假别墅是一件由冷硬石材和落地玻璃构成的杰作，危险地矗立在雾气弥漫的深谷之上。室内空气沉重，充斥着昂贵雪茄的味道和金酒那股凛冽的化学气息。

Masato Bai-Feng sat on a low velvet sofa, swirling a glass of amber liquid. Across from him, Soichiro Kurosaki leaned back, his eyes dark with the remnants of his mourning. They weren't rivals tonight; they were shareholders in a shared commodity.

白凤雅人坐在低矮的丝绒沙发上，摇晃着杯中琥珀色的液体。他的对面，黑崎宗一郎向后靠着，双眼中还带着尚未褪尽的丧子之痛。今晚他们不是对手，而是一件共同商品的股东。

"Lin is desperate," Masato laughed, a dry, sharp sound. "He sent his best asset to sign the papers. He thinks this is a negotiation."

“林家走投无路了，”雅人大笑起来，声音干涩而刺耳。“他派出了他最好的资产来签文件。他以为这是一场谈判。”

Part 2: The Interest Payment

利息的偿付

Saori stood in the center of the room, her grey silk coat already discarded. She wore a slip dress that left nothing to the imagination—a shimmering skin of fabric that clung to her every curve.

沙织站在房间中央，那件灰色丝绸大衣早已被丢在一旁。她穿着一件几乎不留任何想象空间的吊带裙——那是一层闪烁的织物外壳，紧贴着她的每一寸曲线。

"The interest on the first round is due, Saori," Kurosaki said, his voice a low, predatory growl. He beckoned her closer with a flick of his finger. "Since my son can't enjoy the swan, I suppose the secretary will have to suffice for the board."

“第一轮的利息到期了，沙织，”黑崎说道，声音是低沉的、掠食者般的低吼。他勾了勾手指示意她靠近。“既然我儿子没法享用那只天鹅，我想秘书就得替董事会受累了。”

Saori moved toward them, her face a mask of perfect, tragic compliance. She didn't flinch when Masato’s hand slid up her thigh, nor when Kurosaki’s fingers tangled in her hair. She was a vessel waiting to be filled, a silent record of their greed.

沙织走向他们，脸上带着完美且悲剧般的顺从。当雅人的手滑上她的大腿，当黑崎的手指纠缠进她的头发，她都没有退缩。她是一个等待被填充的容器，是记录他们贪婪的无声载体。

Part 3: The Collective Surrender

集体的沦陷

The "paperwork" was forgotten. The men—five of the most powerful figures in the city—surrounded her like wolves. The jokes were crude, the laughter echoing off the glass walls as they stripped away the last of her professional dignity.

“文书工作”被抛诸脑后。这群男人——城市里最有权势的五个身影——像狼群一样围住了她。粗鄙的笑话在玻璃墙间回荡，随着他们剥离她最后的职业尊严，笑声愈发猖狂。

"Does Lin know how well-used you are?" one of them joked, his voice muffled as he pressed Saori against the cold glass. "Does he know his 'Last Line of Defense' is held up by a woman who can't say no to a janitor?"

“林家知道你被用得有多狠吗？”其中一人调侃道，他将沙织按在冰冷的玻璃上，声音显得有些闷。“他知道他那‘最后的防线’其实是靠一个连门房都拒绝不了的女人撑着的吗？”

Saori didn't answer with words. She only offered her body. She was forced into a series of degrading positions, her limbs manipulated like a puppet's. The room became a blurred landscape of sweat, friction, and raw, uninhibited lust. She took them all—one by one, and then all at once—her throat-deep moans filling the space with a bone-deep, honeyed vibration.

沙织没有用语言回答。她只交出了她的身体。她被迫做出各种屈辱的姿势，肢体像木偶般任人摆布。房间变成了汗水、摩擦和原始、放纵欲望交织的模糊景象。她接纳了所有人——一个接一个，随后是同时承受——她那深及喉咙的呻吟声让整个空间充满了入骨且甜腻的震颤。

Part 4: The Shared Heat

共享的热度

The air in the villa became humid, thick with the scent of multiple men and Saori’s frantic, biological response. They treated her like a communal sink for their stress, passing her around with a casual cruelty that would have broken any other woman.

别墅里的空气变得潮湿，弥漫着多个男人的气味和沙织急促的生物反应。他们把她当成宣泄压力的公共水槽，带着随性的残酷将她传阅，这足以击碎任何其他女人。

She was a map of their collective conquest, her skin marked by teeth and fingers, her interior flooded by the seed of half a dozen empires. As Masato drove into her from behind while Kurosaki held her face, Saori’s eyes rolled back, lost in a haze of pure, sensory overload. She was no longer a person; she was the physical manifestation of the Lin family’s debt, being paid back in every wet, slapping stroke.

她是他们集体征服的地图，皮肤上布满齿痕和指印，体内泛滥着半数帝国的精血。当雅人从后方贯穿她，黑崎捧着她的脸时，沙织双眼翻白，迷失在纯粹的感官过载中。她不再是一个人，她是林家债务的具象化，在每一次湿润、啪嗒作响的撞击中被偿还。

Part 5: The Aftermath of the Storm

风暴余波

When the sun began to peek over the ravine, the men were exhausted, slumped in chairs with their shirts open. Saori lay on the rug, a ruined masterpiece of silk and skin. She didn't move to cover herself. She simply lay there, staring at the ceiling, the evidence of their "negotiation" slick on her thighs.

当阳光开始窥视深谷时，男人们已精疲力竭，敞着衬衫瘫在椅子里。沙织躺在地毯上，像一件由丝绸和肌肤构成的、毁掉的杰作。她没有试图遮掩自己。她只是躺在那里，盯着天花板，大腿上还沾着他们“谈判”后的湿粘证据。

"She's a good investment," Masato muttered, lighting a fresh cigar. "Tell Lin the first payment is accepted. We'll see him on Monday."

“她是一项不错的投资，”雅人咕哝着，点燃了一根新雪茄。“告诉林家，第一笔款项收到了。周一见。”

Saori closed her eyes. She felt the weight of the night in every part of her body. She had saved the swan for another few days, but she knew the hunger of these men would only grow.

沙织闭上双眼。她感到身体的每一处都承载着夜晚的重量。她为天鹅又争取了几天的安全，但她知道，这些男人的饥渴只会愈发膨胀。
