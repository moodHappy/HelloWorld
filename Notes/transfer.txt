Hotel Stay

The hotel smelled like lemon cleaner and old carpet. Mark noticed it the moment he stepped inside, dragging his suitcase over a seam in the floor. The lobby looked nicer in the photos—warm lights, polished wood—but up close it felt tired, like it had hosted too many passing lives.

“ID, please,” the receptionist said without looking up.

Mark slid his card across the counter. Business trip. Two nights. He’d already forgotten the purpose of the meeting tomorrow, only that it wasn’t important enough to feel nervous about.

Room 614.

The elevator groaned as it climbed. A woman with a grocery bag stood beside him, the plastic stretched thin with takeaway boxes. They nodded at each other, strangers sharing the same temporary pause.

The room was clean, which was all he really wanted. A bed too wide for one person, a desk facing the wall, a window overlooking a parking lot with flickering lights. He dropped his bag, sat on the edge of the bed, and listened. Somewhere down the hall, a door slammed. A TV murmured through a wall.

He ordered room service out of laziness, not hunger. While waiting, he turned on the TV and let it play without watching. When the food arrived, it was lukewarm pasta in a plastic container. He ate standing by the window, watching a man below struggle to fit a suitcase into a car trunk.

Later that night, the air conditioner rattled on and off. Mark lay awake, staring at the ceiling, counting the stains shaped like continents. Hotels always did this to him—made time feel loose, unanchored. No routines, no responsibilities beyond tomorrow morning.

At 2 a.m., he heard arguing next door. A couple, voices low but sharp. He couldn’t make out the words, only the rhythm of blame. It stopped as suddenly as it began. Silence returned, heavier than before.

In the morning, he overslept. The coffee in the lobby was bitter, but he drank it anyway. On his way out, he saw the same receptionist, still not looking up.

Outside, the air was cold and clean. Mark paused for a moment before getting into his car, the hotel looming behind him—already forgetting him, already ready for the next guest.

Two nights, he thought. Then he drove away.
