The fireworks painted the night sky in brilliant hues of red, blue, and gold. As I sat on the grass with friends, the summer breeze carried the scent of grilled corn and distant laughter. Each explosion echoed in my chest, a perfect punctuation to the season. When the final cascade of light faded into darkness, I knew summer had ended perfectly. The crowd dispersed, and suddenly the night felt empty. Tomorrow would bring autumn's chill, but for now, I held onto the afterimages still dancing behind my eyesâ€”beautiful, fleeting, and already becoming memories.
