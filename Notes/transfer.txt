The Café by the Station

The café sat just outside the station’s side exit, the one locals used when they didn’t want to pass the ticket machines again. It had a clean sign, an ambitious name, and prices that suggested confidence rather than quality.

Inside, the tables were small and closely spaced, as if encouraging brief stays. The coffee menu was long, the cups thin. Everything arrived lukewarm.

People came anyway.

Some came because they were early. Others because they were late and needed something—anything—to justify stopping. The café specialized in pauses, not comfort.

On weekday mornings, a woman in a beige coat sat by the window with her laptop closed, stirring the same cup for too long. She never drank more than half. She checked her phone often, not to reply, just to confirm nothing had arrived. When her train was announced, she left coins on the table even though the café didn’t take cash.

Around noon, two men in reflective vests argued quietly about wiring diagrams. They shared a pastry they didn’t like and complained about the price as if it were a known flaw, like bad weather. One of them said he’d bring lunch tomorrow. He didn’t.

In the afternoons, the café filled with people waiting for someone else’s schedule to decide their own. Parents killing time before pickups. Freelancers pretending to work. Travelers who hadn’t yet accepted that they were stranded.

The barista changed every few months. None of them stayed long enough to learn names. They learned patterns instead—who wanted extra milk but never asked, who paid without looking at the total, who stared out at the tracks as if counting departures.

One evening, a man with a toolbox ordered an espresso he knew would disappoint him. He drank it standing up, scrolling through messages he didn’t answer. He noticed the coffee was bad, noted the price, and decided it was still better than going straight home.

At the corner table, a woman with accounting spreadsheets open on her phone watched people come and go. She stayed less than ten minutes. Long enough to finish the coffee. Not long enough to regret it.

They didn’t speak.

They didn’t need to.

Outside, trains arrived and left on schedule, indifferent to the small negotiations happening over chipped cups. The café remained exactly what it was: overpriced, underwhelming, and useful in ways it never advertised.

Bad coffee, people said, was better than none.

What they meant was that sometimes you needed a place to wait without explaining why.
