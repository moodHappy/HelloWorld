"I think I kinda like you," Jake said, swiping right on his phone.

"Really? So... should we...?" Sarah asked hopefully.

"Nah, let's just block each other now," Jake replied, deadpan.

"Wait, what?!"

"Think about it. If we date, we'll have the honeymoon phase, then get bored, fight, and eventually block each other anyway. Why waste time? Let's skip straight to the endgame. No drama, no heartbreak, just instant digital rejection. Efficiency at its finest!"

Sarah blinked. "That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me."

"Bye forever!" Jake said, hitting the block button.
