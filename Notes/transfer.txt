# The Crown at Our Dinner Table

In our small house on the edge of town, my father ruled with a quiet dignity that made me believe he truly was a king. He never wore a crown of gold, but his presence commanded the same respect as any monarch. When he entered a room, conversations paused and backs straightened, as if by royal decree.

My father worked long hours at the factory, his hands growing calloused and rough, yet he never complained. Each night, he would return home tired but always with a smile for us. "How was school today, little prince?" he would ask, ruffling my hair with those work-worn hands that I imagined had once wielded a scepter.

I remember the winter when money was especially tight. My father went without new boots so that I could have the bicycle I had dreamed of. "A king provides for his heir," he said simply when I discovered his sacrifice. That night, I watched him walk through the snow in his old, worn boots, and I thought I saw a golden aura surrounding him like the royal mantle I imagined he deserved.

When neighborhood troubles arose, people came to our doorstep seeking my father's counsel. They sat at our kitchen table as if it were a throne room, speaking in respectful tones about disputes and disagreements. My father would listen carefully, his brow furrowed in concentration, before offering wisdom that always seemed to settle matters peacefully. I watched from the doorway, proud that my king could bring harmony to our small kingdom.

Now that I've grown older, I understand that my father was just a man doing his best for his family. But in my heart, he remains a king—my king—whose reign of love and sacrifice continues to guide me long after I've left our small kingdom by the edge of town.
