# The Reflection in the Crystal Ball

I found this crystal ball at a garage sale. At first, it just showed my normal reflection. Then things got creepy. My reflection started doing things I wasn'tâ€”smiling when I frowned, looking behind me when I faced forward. Last night, it mouthed "help me." Today, it showed a figure with a knife behind me. But when I turned, nothing was there. Is it showing me the future, or something that's already here? I can't stop staring at that ball, even though it terrifies me.
