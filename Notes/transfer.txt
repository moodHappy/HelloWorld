"Hey, have you ever seen a unicorn?" asked Lily, eyes wide with excitement.
"Nah, but I heard they're super shy," replied Tom, scrolling through his phone.
"Dude, what about dragons? Imagine riding one!"
"Too scary for me! I'd rather have a griffin as a pet."
"Why?"
"Because they can actually be friendly, unlike those fire-breathing monsters!"
Lily laughed. "You're such a wimp! But yeah, magic creatures are awesome."
"Totally! Though I'd settle for a talking cat. They must have some good gossip, right?"
