Chapter 2: The Frequency of the Abyss

第二章：频率中的深渊

Part 1: The Observer’s Sanctuary

观察者的圣域

Three blocks away from the Lin estate, inside a nondescript black van, the atmosphere was clinical and cold. Hasegawa Makoto sat before a bank of monitors, his tuxedo jacket discarded, sleeves rolled up to reveal a predatory focus. He wasn't looking at a girl; he was monitoring a frequency. On the screen, a jagged green line spiked and dipped—the digital heartbeat of the Lin family’s most private sanctuary.

距离林家大宅三个街区的一辆不起眼的黑色厢式货车内，气氛冷峻如诊室。长谷川诚坐在几台监视器前，脱掉了燕尾服外套，卷起的袖口露出了掠食者般的专注。他盯着的不是一个女孩，而是一个频率。屏幕上，一条锯齿状的绿线起伏波动——那是林家最私密圣殿的数字脉搏。

He pressed his headphones closer. Through the high-fidelity feed of the diamond necklace, he could hear the rustle of Miyetsuko’s silk dress as she walked, a sound that cost thousands of dollars per second. Then, the heavy, double-oak doors of the study closed with a final, echoing thud.

他将耳机按得更紧了一些。通过那条钻石项链传回的高保真信号，他能听到美悦子走动时丝绸礼服摩擦的声音，那是一种每秒价值千金的声响。随后，书房沉重的双扇橡木门关上了，发出一声沉闷的、带着回响的重击声。

"You’re late, Miyetsuko," a man’s voice rasped through the static. It was Lin, the patriarch—the man whose signature once moved markets, now sounding like a cornered animal.

“你迟到了，美悦子。”一个男人的声音穿透静电传了出来。那是林氏集团的掌权者——那个签名曾能搅动市场的男人，现在的声音听起来却像一只走投无路的野兽。

Part 2: The Price of a Fortress

堡垒的代价

"I had to say goodbye to the guests, Father," Miyetsuko’s voice was clear, yet Makoto’s software detected a 12% tremor in her vocal cords. She was terrified.

“我得去送别客人，父亲。”美悦子的声音很清晰，但诚的软件检测到她的声带有12%的颤抖。她在害怕。

"Forget the guests! They are vultures smelling rot," Lin shouted. There was the sound of a glass shattering—expensive crystal meeting a cold truth. "The auditor found the offshore discrepancies. The government is moving faster than we anticipated. If we don't secure the bailout from the Kurosaki Group by Monday, this house, your piano, your very name... it all becomes ash."

“别管那些客人了！他们是闻到了腐肉味的秃鹫，”林大声吼道。接着传来了玻璃破碎的声音——昂贵的水晶杯撞上了冰冷的现实。“审计员发现了海外账目的偏差。政府的动作比我们预想的要快。如果周一之前我们拿不到黑崎集团的紧急援助，这栋房子，你的钢琴，你的名字……一切都会化为灰烬。”

In the van, Makoto leaned back, a thin, cruel smile playing on his lips. He watched the green line spike as Miyetsuko gasped.

车厢内，诚向后靠去，唇角带着一丝浅淡而残酷的笑意。他看着美悦子倒吸一口凉气时，那条绿线瞬间窜高。

"And the price?" Miyetsuko whispered.

“那代价呢？”美悦子低声问道。

"The price is you," her father replied, his voice devoid of paternal warmth. "Kurosaki doesn't want our stocks. He wants a trophy. He wants the 'Last Line of Defense' to grace his son’s bed. You will sign the betrothal agreement tonight."

“代价就是你，”她父亲回答，声音里毫无父爱的温情。“黑崎不想要我们的股份，他想要一个奖杯。他要这道‘最后的防线’去装点他儿子的床榻。你今晚就得签了这份婚约。”

Part 3: The Weaver’s Satisfaction

织网者的满足

Makoto closed his eyes, savoring the silence that followed. He could imagine Miyetsuko standing there, her white dress shimmering in the dim light of the study, the diamond necklace—his leash—cold against her skin. She was being sold by the man who claimed to protect her, and she had nowhere to run but into the arms of the one person who was already listening to her soul.

诚闭上眼，享受着随之而来的沉默。他能想象出美悦子站在那里的样子：她的白色礼服在书房昏暗的灯光下闪烁，而那条钻石项链——他的枷锁——冰冷地贴在她的皮肤上。她正在被那个声称保护她的男人卖掉，而她无处可逃，只能投向那个早已在倾听她灵魂的人的怀抱。

He reached out and adjusted a dial, amplifying the sound of her rapid, shallow breathing. It sounded like a trapped swan beating its wings against a glass cage.

他伸出手调整了一个拨盘，放大了她那急促、浅表的呼吸声。那听起来就像一只被困的天鹅，正对着玻璃笼子拍打着翅膀。

"Beautiful," Makoto whispered to the empty van. "Don't cry yet, little swan. I haven't even started pulling the strings."

“真美，”诚对着空荡荡的车厢低声呢叫。“先别哭，小天鹅。我还没开始拉动琴弦呢。”
