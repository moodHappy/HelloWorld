Chapter 48: The Engine of Flesh

第四十八章：血肉引擎

The boat rocked rhythmically with the waves, a cradle suspended in the abyss. But inside the cockpit, the rhythm was violent and erratic.

小船随着波浪有节奏地摇晃，像悬挂在深渊上的摇篮。但在驾驶舱里，节奏是暴烈且不规律的。

Miyetsuko wasn't asking for love. She was asking to be broken and put back together.

美悦子不是在索求爱。她是在索求被打碎，然后再被重组。

"Look at me," she grabbed Chen Mo's face, forcing him to look at her in the moonlight. Her pupils were dilated, swallowing the darkness. "I am not Mrs. Kurosaki anymore. I am just... meat. Your meat."

“看着我，”她捧住陈默的脸，强迫他在月光下看着她。她的瞳孔放大，吞噬了黑暗。“我不再是黑崎夫人了。我只是一块……肉。你的肉。”

She arched her back, pressing her heavy, wet chest against Chen Mo's face again. The sensation was suffocating—a mix of seawater's chill and her body's searing heat. The salty taste of her skin mixed with the metallic tang of adrenaline.

她弓起背，再次将那沉重、湿润的胸口压在陈默脸上。那种感觉令人窒息——海水冰冷与她体温滚烫的混合。她皮肤上的咸味混合着肾上腺素的金属味。

Chen Mo gripped her waist. Her skin was slippery with sweat and sea spray, making it hard to hold, but her flesh was so soft that his fingers sank deep into it, creating anchors.

陈默抓着她的腰。她的皮肤因为汗水和海浪而湿滑，难以抓握，但她的肉太软了，手指深深地陷了进去，那是天然的锚点。

"Then hold on tight," Chen Mo growled.

“那就抓紧了，”陈默低吼。

He lifted her hips. The boat pitched suddenly on a swell, throwing them off balance. Miyetsuko gasped, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist to keep from being thrown overboard.

他托起她的臀部。小船突然在涌浪上颠簸，让他们失去平衡。美悦子倒吸一口冷气，双腿死死缠住他的腰，以免被甩出船外。

That fear of falling into the black ocean only intensified the pleasure. They were fucking on the edge of a razor.

那种随时可能掉进黑色海洋的恐惧，反而加剧了快感。他们在刀锋上做爱。

Every thrust was met with a slap of skin against skin that echoed louder than the waves. Her soft, voluptuous body absorbed every impact, rippling like water, wrapping around him, milking him of every drop of fear and rage he had stored up during the escape.

每一次撞击都伴随着皮肤拍打的声音，比海浪声还要响亮。她那柔软丰腴的身体吸收了每一次冲击，像水波一样荡漾，包裹着他，榨干他在逃亡中积攒的每一滴恐惧和愤怒。

"Yes... destroy me..." she sobbed into the night wind, her nails digging into Chen Mo's back, drawing blood again. "Make me forget the price of the bonds... make me forget the gun..."

“对……毁了我……”她在夜风中呜咽，指甲掐进陈默的背，再次抓出了血。“让我忘了债券的价格……让我忘了那把枪……”
