Chapter 59: The Napkin Note

第五十九章：餐巾纸上的便条

8:00 PM. Kurosaki Heavy Industries.

晚上8点。黑崎重工。

Kurosaki Soichiro was watching the evening news in his office. His face was gray. The stock price had plummeted 35% today. The board was calling for his resignation.

黑崎宗一郎正在办公室看晚间新闻。他脸色灰败。股价今天暴跌了35%。董事会在要求他辞职。

"Breaking: Mysterious Couple Leaves Record Tip at Ginza Restaurant."

“突发新闻：神秘情侣在银座餐厅留下创纪录的小费。”

The news anchor showed a photo of the receipt. A bill for 3 million yen. Paid in cash. And a tip of another 1 million yen.

新闻主播展示了一张收据的照片。300万日元的账单。现金支付。还有100万日元的小费。

"But what's shocking is the note left on the napkin," the reporter said, zooming in on the handwritten note.

“但令人震惊的是留在餐巾纸上的便条，”记者说着，镜头拉近那张手写便条。

It was written in lipstick. "Vengeance Red."

是用口红写的。“复仇红”。

“Dear Kurosaki-san. The steak here is excellent. Much better than the dog food you served me for 10 years. P.S. We spent your tank money. It tasted delicious.”

“亲爱的黑崎先生。这里的牛排很棒。比你喂了我10年的狗粮好吃多了。P.S. 我们花了你的坦克钱。味道真不错。”

Kurosaki stared at the screen. He recognized the handwriting. He recognized the lipstick shade.

黑崎盯着屏幕。他认得那个笔迹。他认得那个口红颜色。

"AHHHH!!!!"

“啊！！！！”

He picked up a crystal ashtray and hurled it at the TV screen. The screen shattered, sparking and dying.

他抓起一个水晶烟灰缸，狠狠砸向电视屏幕。屏幕碎裂，火花四溅后熄灭。

"Find them! They are in Ginza! Burn the whole district down if you have to!"

“找到他们！他们在银座！就算烧了整个街区也要把他们找出来！”
