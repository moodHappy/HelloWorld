# Midnight Sketches

Emma loved to draw, filling notebooks with fantastical creatures and impossible landscapes. Her pencils flew across pages, bringing her imagination to life in vibrant colors.

One night, she woke to find her dragon sketch breathing tiny puffs of smoke. The paper boat she'd drawn earlier was sailing across her desk. Emma realized her creations came alive when the moon was high.

Now she draws with purpose, creating helpful creatures to tidy her room and gentle monsters to guard her dreams. Each morning, only the drawings remain, but Emma knows her friends will return with the next moonrise.
