Emma woke up with a raw, scratchy feeling in her throat. Each swallow felt like swallowing glass.
艾玛醒来时喉咙里有种刺痛的感觉。每次吞咽都像是在吞玻璃。

She knew the symptoms well – it was pharyngitis again. The tea with honey offered temporary relief as she canceled her plans for the day.

By afternoon, her voice was reduced to a painful whisper. The doctor confirmed what she already knew: rest, fluids, and time were the only cures.
到了下午，她的声音变成了痛苦的低语。医生确认了她早已知道的事实：休息、多喝水和时间是唯一的治疗方法。

As she curled up with a book, Emma reflected on how something so small could bring her busy life to a complete halt, forcing her to finally slow down.
当她蜷缩在沙发上看书时，艾玛反思着，如何一个如此微小的症状，竟能让她忙碌的生活彻底停顿，迫使她最终放慢脚步。
