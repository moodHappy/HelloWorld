Imagine if Google Maps had a fog of war setting like in video games! My friend Tom installed this hack last week, and now our city feels like an adventure. Everywhere we haven't visited is covered in digital fog. We can't see what's there until we actually go explore it. Yesterday, we discovered this awesome taco place just three blocks from my apartment that I never knew existed! It's like being an explorer in your own hometown. Sure, sometimes I get lost more often, but that's half the fun. Life's definitely more interesting when you can't just peek at your phone to see everything!
