The children's TV show Sesame Street is moving to the streaming service Netflix. The show started in the USA in 1969. It is one of the world's most loved programmes. There have been 4,731 episodes over 55 seasons. Netflix said the programme is a "beloved [part] of children's media, enchanting young minds and [encouraging] a love of learning". Netflix announced that the show's 56th season would have "fresh format changes". In the new season, viewers will see a return of popular parts of the show like Elmo's World and Cookie Monster's Foodie Truck. Well-known characters like Big Bird, Count von Count and Abby Cadabby will also continue to entertain youngsters.

The Netflix streaming deal will make sure that Sesame Street will continue to educate young children for years to come. Netflix said the show brings "critical early learning to children throughout the country for free". Education was a key reason why Sesame Street was created. In the late 1960s, psychologist Lloyd Morrisett and TV producer Joan Ganz Cooney thought of the idea of the show. They worked with Harvard University's School of Education to think of a new way to teach America's pre-school children. Since 1969, Sesame Street has taught basic maths, literacy, and social skills to children worldwide. It also encouraged tolerance and diversity.
