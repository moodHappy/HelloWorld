"Living with my mother-in-law was like walking on eggshells. 'You're spoiling the kids,' she'd say when I gave them extra snacks. 'You should be stricter!' Meanwhile, I thought she was too old-fashioned. The real battle started when she wanted to move in permanently to help with childcare. 'We need our space,' I told my husband. 'But she's family,' he replied. Every day was a negotiation about whose way was right - hers or mine. Sometimes I bit my tongue to keep the peace, other times I stood my ground. It's exhausting, this dance between love and boundaries, between doing what's right for your kids and respecting tradition. But somehow, we make it work most days."
