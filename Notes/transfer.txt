Grandpa's ancient leather shoes had more patches than original material. "They're comfortable!" he'd insist, wearing them to every family occasion. Last Sunday, during my wedding ceremony, we heard a loud RIP. Grandpa's shoe sole had finally given up, flapping like a lonely flag as he walked down the aisle. The entire church erupted in laughter while Grandpa, oblivious, continued marching proudly. Later, I asked why he cherished those decrepit shoes. He winked, "Son, these shoes have outlasted three wives, two dogs, and one hip replacement. They're not just shoesâ€”they're my good luck charm!" Some traditions, I realized, are worth keeping.
