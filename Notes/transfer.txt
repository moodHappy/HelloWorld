In the past, people need the night sky to live.

In Australia, the Milky Way lights up the night. Aboriginal people watch stars to know when to pick food. Polynesians travel the Pacific Ocean by watching the stars. European sailors also use the sky to find their way. Ancient places like Stonehenge and Newgrange help people know time. People hold ceremonies during the shortest days of the year.

Today, we use GPS instead of the stars. But too much light at night makes it hard for people and animals, like birds, to see the night sky.
