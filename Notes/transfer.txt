Chapter 4: The Aftermath

第四章：余烬

The Morning After.

次日清晨。

Consciousness returned to Miyetsuko like a slow, painful poison.

意识像一种缓慢、痛苦的毒药回到了美悦子体内。

She was lying on the tatami mat, curled into a fetal position. The air in the room was stale, heavy with the metallic tang of blood, the musky scent of dried semen, and the sour smell of fear. Her body felt like a wreckage. Her jaw was swollen, her throat raw and burning, and her lower body throbbed with a dull, constant ache. Dried fluids—his and hers—crusted her inner thighs and her chest.

她蜷缩在榻榻米上，像个胎儿一样。房间里的空气污浊，充斥着血的铁锈味、干涸精液的麝香味和恐惧的酸臭味。她的身体像是一片废墟。下颚肿胀，喉咙火辣辣地疼，下半身传来持续的钝痛。干结的体液——他的和她的——像硬壳一样粘在她的大腿内侧和胸口。

The Shiromuku lay in a heap in the corner, torn and stained. A ruined flag of surrender.

那件白无垢像一堆垃圾一样丢在角落里，被撕破了，满是污渍。像一面被毁坏的投降白旗。

Slide.

哗啦。

The door opened. Not the violent slam of Kurosaki, but a smooth, calculated slide.

门开了。不是黑崎那种暴力的撞击，而是一种平滑、经过计算的滑动声。

Light flooded the room. It was too bright. Miyetsuko squinted, shielding her eyes with a bruised arm.

光线涌入房间。太刺眼了。美悦子眯起眼睛，用布满淤青的手臂挡住光。

Mrs. Sato entered first, bowing deeply. Then, She walked in.

佐藤夫人先走了进来，深深鞠躬。然后，她走了进来。

Kurosaki Reiko. The Mistress of the house.

**黑崎丽子。**这所房子的女主人。

She was forty-five, but looked thirty. Her skin was porcelain white, her lips painted a precise crimson. She wore a dark purple kimono with a pattern of falling autumn leaves—elegant, expensive, and impeccable. She held a folding fan in her hand, pressing it against her nose as she surveyed the room.

她四十五岁，但看起来只有三十出头。皮肤像瓷器一样白，嘴唇涂着精致的深红。她穿着一件深紫色的和服，上面是落叶的图案——优雅、昂贵、无懈可击。她手里拿着一把折扇，掩在鼻端，审视着这个房间。

She looked at the overturned sake bottle. She looked at the stains on the pristine mat. Finally, her cold eyes landed on the naked, shivering girl on the floor.

她看着打翻的清酒瓶。她看着崭新榻榻米上的污渍。最后，她冰冷的目光落在了地板上那个赤裸、颤抖的女孩身上。

She didn't look jealous. She looked like a restaurant owner finding a dead rat in the kitchen.

她没有表现出嫉妒。她的神情就像餐馆老板在厨房里发现了一只死老鼠。

"Open the windows," Reiko said. Her voice was calm, melodic, and utterly devoid of warmth. "It smells like a slaughterhouse in here."

“把窗户打开，”丽子说。她的声音平静、悦耳，却完全没有温度。“这里闻起来像个屠宰场。”

Mrs. Sato hurried to obey. The cold morning air rushed in, making Miyetsuko shiver violently.

佐藤夫人急忙照做。清晨寒冷的空气灌了进来，让美悦子剧烈地颤抖起来。

Reiko walked closer, her white tabi socks avoiding the wet spots on the floor. She stopped inches from Miyetsuko’s face.

丽子走近了些，她白色的足袋小心地避开了地板上的湿渍。她在离美悦子脸几英寸的地方停了下来。

"Look at me," she commanded.

“看着我，”她命令道。

Miyetsuko slowly lifted her head. Her eyes were red, swollen from crying.

美悦子缓缓抬起头。她的眼睛红肿，那是哭泣过的痕迹。

Reiko used her closed fan to lift Miyetsuko’s chin, tilting her face left and right. She inspected the bruises on her cheek, then lowered the fan to poke at one of Miyetsuko’s massive breasts.

丽子用合拢的折扇抬起美悦子的下巴，左右转动着她的脸。她检查了她脸颊上的淤青，然后垂下折扇，戳了戳美悦子那巨大的乳房。

"Excessive," Reiko murmured with a sneer. "Disgustingly fertile. No wonder he lost control. Men are simple creatures; they see a cow, they want to milk it."

“过剩，”丽子带着冷笑低语。“恶心的繁殖欲。难怪他会失控。男人这种简单的生物，看到奶牛就想挤奶。”

"Please..." Miyetsuko rasped, her voice barely a whisper. "Help me..."

“求求你……”美悦子嘶哑地说道，声音微弱得几乎听不见。“救救我……”

Reiko’s eyes narrowed. She pulled the fan away as if it had touched something contagious.

丽子的眼睛眯了起来。她收回折扇，仿佛它碰到了什么传染病源。

"Help you?" Reiko laughed softly. "You misunderstand your position, child. You think you are a victim? No. You are a debt. A number on a ledger."

“救你？”丽子轻笑了一声。“你搞不清自己的位置，孩子。你以为你是受害者？不。你是一笔债。账本上的一个数字。”

She turned to Mrs. Sato.

她转向佐藤夫人。

"Burn that mat. And burn those clothes."

“把那张榻榻米烧了。还有那些衣服也烧了。”

Then she looked back at Miyetsuko.

然后她回头看着美悦子。

"Listen carefully. In this house, we do not have free loaders. My husband uses you at night to drain his... urges. That is your purpose. But during the day? You will not sit around like a pampered concubine."

“听好了。在这个家里，不养闲人。我丈夫晚上用你来发泄他的……冲动。那是你的用途。但白天？你别想像个受宠的小妾一样坐着享福。”

Reiko leaned down, her voice dropping to a whisper that cut deeper than any knife.

丽子俯下身，声音压低成耳语，却比任何刀子都割得更深。

"You will work. You will scrub the floors. You will wash the dishes. You will clean the toilets used by the servants. You are lower than the maids. You are the text-book definition of a slut—a hole for use, and hands for labor."

“你要干活。你要擦地板。你要洗碗。你要去刷佣人用的厕所。你比女仆还要低贱。你是教科书定义的贱货——一个用来用的洞，一双用来干活的手。”

Miyetsuko stared at her, tears drying on her cheeks. The shock was turning into a cold, hard lump in her stomach.

美悦子盯着她，泪水在脸颊上干涸。震惊正在她胃里变成一团冰冷坚硬的东西。

"If you break a plate, you don't eat. If you refuse him at night, I will let the guards have a turn. Do you understand?"

“打破一个盘子，就不许吃饭。如果晚上拒绝他，我就让警卫轮流进来。听懂了吗？”

Miyetsuko didn't answer immediately.

美悦子没有立刻回答。

THWACK.

啪。

Reiko struck her across the face with the folded fan. It was a sharp, stinging blow.

丽子用折扇狠狠抽了她的脸。那是一记尖锐、刺痛的打击。

"Answer me, dog."

“回答我，母狗。”

Miyetsuko lowered her head, her forehead touching the cold, soiled mat. She closed her eyes, hiding the spark of hatred that had just ignited in the dark.

美悦子低下了头，额头触碰到了冰冷、肮脏的榻榻米。她闭上眼睛，掩盖了黑暗中刚刚点燃的那一丝仇恨的火花。

"Yes... Mistress."

“是……夫人。”

Reiko smiled, satisfied. She stood up and smoothed her kimono.

丽子满意地笑了。她站直身子，抚平了和服。

"Good. Now, clean this mess up." She gestured to the fluids on the floor. "Lick it clean if you have to. I want this room spotless in an hour."

“很好。现在，把这一地狼藉清理干净。”她指着地上的体液。“如果有必要，舔干净也可以。我要这房间在一小时内一尘不染。”

She turned and walked out, leaving a trail of expensive perfume to mask the stench of ruin.

她转身走了出去，留下一路昂贵的香水味，试图掩盖这里的毁灭气息。

Miyetsuko was left alone again. She looked at the door where the woman had vanished. She looked at her own trembling hands.

美悦子又是一个人了。她看着那个女人消失的门口。她看着自己颤抖的双手。

Slowly, painfully, she reached for a rag that Mrs. Sato had dropped. She began to wipe the floor.

缓慢地，痛苦地，她伸手去拿佐藤夫人扔下的抹布。她开始擦地板。

She wasn't cleaning. She was erasing the girl she used to be.

她不是在打扫。她是在擦去那个曾经的自己。
