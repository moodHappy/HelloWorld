Beyond

I missed my stop again.

Not by accident this time.
I saw the sign coming, counted down in my head, and still stayed in my seat.

The bus rolled past it like nothing mattered.

A guy next to me glanced over.
“Didn’t you need that stop?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I just… felt like going a little further.”

He nodded, like that made sense. On public transport, it always does.

My phone buzzed.
Where are you?
I typed, Almost there, even though I wasn’t.

Outside, the streets slowly changed. Fewer shops. More houses. Quieter.

When the bus finally stopped, I got off and stood there for a moment. Cold air, empty road, no rush.

Sometimes you don’t miss things.
Sometimes you go beyond them on purpose.
