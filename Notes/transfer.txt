Chapter 21: The Necessary Sacrifice

第二十一章：必要的牺牲

Chen Mo was stunned. "Emergency Purge?"

陈默愣住了。“紧急清洗？”

"Yes," Miyetsuko leaned forward, her eyes burning with fanaticism. "When the system detects a foreign virus—like the 'Affair Photos' I made you upload—it panics. It moves all sensitive data to a temporary 'Trash Can' partition for 30 seconds before deleting it. During those 30 seconds, the encryption is lifted."

“是的。”美悦子前倾身体，眼中燃烧着狂热。“当系统检测到外来病毒——比如我让你上传的那些‘偷情照片’——它会恐慌。它会把所有敏感数据移动到一个临时的‘垃圾桶’分区，准备在30秒后删除。在那30秒里，加密是解除的。”

"So..." Chen Mo's hand trembling on the glass stopped.

“所以……”陈默握着酒杯的手停住了。

"So, I didn't want to destroy the evidence. I was unlocking it." She sneered. "I needed a bait to trigger the alarm. I needed someone stupid enough, brave enough, and desperate enough to stay in that freezing hell for those exact 30 seconds to catch the data stream."

“所以，我不是想销毁证据。我是在解锁它。”她冷笑一声。“我需要一个诱饵去触发警报。我需要一个足够蠢、足够勇敢、也足够绝望的人，在那该死的30秒里待在那个冰冷的地狱，接住那股数据流。”

"You knew I would copy it?"

“你知道我会复制它？”

"I gambled." She reached out and touched Chen Mo's face, her fingers warm this time. "I gambled that you are a top-tier analyst. I gambled that your survival instinct would make you find the 'Trash Can' directory. If you had just run away, you would be dead by now. But you didn't. You copied it."

“我赌了一把。”她伸出手，抚摸陈默的脸，这次她的手指是热的。“我赌你是个顶级的分析师。我赌你的求生本能会让你找到那个‘垃圾桶’目录。如果你刚才逃跑了，你现在已经是个死人了。但你没有。你复制了它。”

Chen Mo looked at the woman in front of him. He felt a chill deeper than liquid nitrogen.

陈默看着眼前的女人。他感到一种比液氮更深的寒意。

She wasn't a traitor. She was a commander. She sent her soldier on a suicide mission, betting that he would come back alive with the trophy.

她不是叛徒。她是个指挥官。她把她的士兵送上了自杀式的战场，赌他能活着带回战利品。

"You are crazy," Chen Mo whispered. "What if I died?"

“你是个疯子。”陈默低声说。“万一我死了呢？”

Miyetsuko's hand slid down to his neck, tracing the artery.

美悦子的手滑到了他的脖颈，抚摸着大动脉。

"Then I would cry for you. Truly." Her eyes softened for a second, then hardened again. "But to bring down the Kurosaki Empire, one life is a cheap price to pay. Even if it's yours. Even if it's... mine."

“那我会为你哭泣。真心的。”她的眼神软了一秒，随即又变得坚硬。“但为了推翻黑崎帝国，一条人命是很廉价的代价。哪怕是你的。哪怕是……我的。”
