Chapter 38: Waking Up in Hell

第三十八章：在地狱中醒来

"No!"

“不！”

Miyetsuko screamed, waking up with a start.

美悦子尖叫着，猛地醒来。

The smell of old tatami mats and blood was gone. Replaced by the smell of high-octane gasoline, burning rubber, and the humid, rot-scented air of Rio.

陈旧榻榻米和血的味道消失了。取而代之的是高辛烷值汽油、燃烧的橡胶和里约潮湿腐烂的空气味。

She wasn't on a futon. She was in the bucket seat of a stolen, modified Land Rover Defender. The engine was roaring like a beast.

她不在被褥上。她在一辆偷来的、改装过的路虎卫士的桶形座椅里。引擎像野兽一样咆哮。

She looked down. No white kimono. She was wearing the black tactical bodysuit and the tight Kevlar vest Chen Mo had strapped on her.

她低头看。没有白无垢。她穿着那件黑色战术紧身衣和陈默给她穿上的紧身凯夫拉背心。

"Nightmare?" Chen Mo's voice was calm, cutting through the noise.

“做噩梦了？”陈默的声音平静，穿透了噪音。

He was in the passenger seat, reloading a submachine gun. He checked her face. She was sweating, her pupils dilated.

他在副驾驶座上，正在给一把冲锋枪换弹夹。他查看她的脸。她在出汗，瞳孔放大。

"I dreamt of him. Of the wedding," she gripped the steering wheel so hard the leather creaked.

“我梦见了他。梦见了婚礼，”她死死抓着方向盘，皮套发出嘎吱声。

"He's in a cell in Tokyo. You are in Rio," Chen Mo racked the slide of the gun. "Drive, Miyetsuko. The Butcher found us."

“他在东京的牢房里。你在里约，”陈默拉动枪栓。“开车，美悦子。屠夫找到我们了。”
