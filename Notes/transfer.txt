Once upon a time in a small village, a weary traveler approached a wise old man, seeking directions to the town's famous fountain. The old man listened patiently, then instructed the traveler to take the path through the forest and follow the sound of the river.

As the traveler walked, the path forked. Unsure which way to go, he remembered the old man's advice. He listened closely, and the sound of the river guided him to the left. Eventually, he reached the sparkling fountain, the village's pride and joy.

Grateful, the traveler returned to the old man, thanked him, and shared the beauty of the fountain. The wise old man smiled, "Knowledge, like the river, guides us to our destination."
