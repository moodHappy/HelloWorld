A Normal Morning

Tom woke up ten minutes late.

He jumped out of bed, brushed his teeth in a hurry, and grabbed the first shirt he could find. It had a small coffee stain, but he decided no one would notice.

In the kitchen, his phone buzzed.
A message from his mom: “Did you eat breakfast?”

He smiled and typed, “Of course.”
Then he took a banana from the counter and ran out the door.

The bus was crowded, as usual. A woman stepped on his foot and apologized. Tom said, “It’s okay,” even though it hurt a little.

At work, his computer took forever to start. He stared at the screen, thinking about coffee. When it finally turned on, he realized he had forgotten his charger.

At lunchtime, a coworker shared half of her sandwich with him.
“Rough morning?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Tom said, laughing. “But it’s getting better.”

That evening, Tom went home tired but calm. He ate instant noodles, watched a silly show, and answered his mom’s message again.

“Yes,” he typed. “I ate.”

It wasn’t a special day.
But it was a good one.
