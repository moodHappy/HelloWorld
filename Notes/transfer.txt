Grandpa proudly showed off his new toy gun at the family picnic. "Watch this!" he shouted, aiming at a squirrel. He pulled the trigger, and instead of a harmless "pop," a flag reading "BANG!" shot out and poked him right in the eye. As he stumbled backward, he accidentally fired again, this time hitting Uncle Bob's prized apple pie. The family howled with laughter as Grandpa, now with a black eye and covered in pie, muttered, "I swear this thing is out to get me." Even the squirrel seemed to be chuckling from the safety of its tree.
