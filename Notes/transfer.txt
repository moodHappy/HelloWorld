Title: "Iranians Fear for Their Lives as Israel Strikes Tehran"

Many people in Tehran, Iran's capital city, are living in fear after Israel's sudden attack on Friday morning. Residents are shocked and confused, and some are trying to escape the city. Long queues can be seen at petrol stations and bakeries, and people are preparing for the worst.

A 21-year-old music student, who wants to remain anonymous, said she hasn't slept for nights. "Everyone is leaving, but I'm not," she said. "My dad says it's more honourable to die in your own house than to run away." She fears that Tehran might become like Gaza, which has been badly damaged by Israeli attacks.

Another woman said she initially felt a "strange excitement" when she heard that Israeli strikes had killed powerful Iranian military officials. However, when she heard that ordinary people had also been killed, she started to feel sorrow, fear, and sadness.

More than 220 people, including many women and children, have been killed in the attacks, according to Iranian authorities. Israeli authorities say Iranian missiles have killed at least 24 people in Israel.

Many Iranians are angry and scared, and some are preparing for the possibility of death. They are also worried about the future of their country and the impact of the conflict on their lives.

Some people are divided in their opinions, with some celebrating the regime's losses and others angry at those cheering Israel on. Many Iranians are also worried about the humanitarian disaster unfolding in their country.

Iranians living abroad are also concerned about the situation. One activist said it's hard to convey what it's like to be an Iranian right now, feeling happy that members of the regime are being targeted but also knowing that civilians are dying.

The situation in Tehran remains tense and uncertain, with many people fearing for their lives and their future.
