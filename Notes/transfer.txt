Sarah rushed through the crowded streets, checking her watch nervously. She was late again—twenty minutes behind schedule for the most important job interview of her life. The bus had broken down, then it started raining. When she finally arrived, breathless and soaked, the receptionist gave her a sympathetic look. "They've already begun the next candidate," she said softly. Sarah's heart sank. All those preparations, all those dreams, washed away by circumstances beyond her control. She walked out slowly, realizing that sometimes being late isn't just about losing time—it's about losing opportunities you may never get back.
