Chapter 44: The Red Star

第四十四章：红色星辰

"They are in range!" Chen Mo yelled over the roar of the twin engines.

“他们进入射程了！”陈默在双引擎的咆哮声中大喊。

Two searchlights from behind locked onto them like the eyes of deep-sea predators. Bullets began to chew up the water around the stern, sending up geysers of spray. Thwack-thwack-thwack. Fiberglass shards flew into the cockpit.

身后的两道探照灯像深海掠食者的眼睛一样锁定了他们。子弹开始撕咬船尾周围的水面，激起一道道水柱。砰-砰-砰。 玻璃钢碎片飞进驾驶舱。

Miyetsuko stood up on the passenger seat, holding onto the roll bar with one hand, the flare gun in the other.

美悦子在副驾驶座上站了起来，一只手抓着防滚架，另一只手举着信号枪。

The wind whipped her wet hair into a frenzy. Her leather suit was unzipped almost to her belt now. As the boat slammed into the waves, her heavy, pale chest bounced violently, gleaming with sweat and sea spray in the enemy's searchlights.

狂风把她的湿发吹得狂乱飞舞。她的皮衣拉链现在几乎拉到了腰带。随着快艇猛烈撞击海浪，她那沉重、苍白的胸口剧烈颠簸，在敌人的探照灯下闪烁着汗水和海浪的光泽。

"Hey, assholes!" She screamed into the wind, her voice filled with manic joy. "Happy New Year!"
“嘿，混蛋们！”她迎着风尖叫，声音里充满了疯狂的快乐。“新年快乐！”

She didn't fire up into the sky. She aimed straight back, directly at the bridge of the leading interceptor boat.

她没有朝天开枪。她直接向后瞄准，直指领头拦截艇的驾驶台。

POOM!

嘭！

A blinding red magnesium star shot out of the barrel. It drew a flat, angry line across the dark water, slamming right into the glass windshield of the pursuer.

一颗刺眼的红色镁光星弹射出枪膛。它在黑暗的水面上划出一道平直、愤怒的红线，狠狠砸在追击者的玻璃挡风玻璃上。

The glass shattered. The flare exploded inside the cabin, filling it with blinding red smoke and fire. The boat swerved violently to the right, crashing into the second boat's wake.

玻璃碎裂。信号弹在船舱内爆炸，充满了致盲的红烟和火焰。那艘船剧烈向右急转，撞进了第二艘船的尾迹里。
