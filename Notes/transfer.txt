Madame Li's crystal ball had foretold many fates, but none as mysterious as the young woman who visited today. As the woman placed her trembling hands on the table, Madame Li saw visions of a lost love and a hidden treasure. "You must find the locket beneath the old willow tree," she whispered. The woman gaspedâ€”only her beloved had known about that spot. That evening, beneath the silver moonlight, the locket yielded not just a faded photograph, but a tiny key to a safety deposit box containing proof of an inheritance she never knew existed. The future Madame Li had glimpsed was now her past, finally set free.
