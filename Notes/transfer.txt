Chapter 4: The Rain-Slicked Salvation

第四章：雨中的救赎

Part 1: The Shattered Glass

碎裂的玻璃

The double doors of the Lin estate burst open, and Miyetsuko stepped into the deluge. The night air was a physical blow, a wall of cold water that instantly began to melt the starch of her white gala dress. She didn't look back at the "fortress" that had just become her auction house.

林家大门砰然撞开，美悦子冲进了暴雨之中。夜晚的空气如同一记重击，冰冷的水墙瞬间开始融化她白色盛装礼服上的浆气。她没有回头看那座刚刚变成她拍卖场的“堡垒”。

Her breath came in ragged, burning gasps. The pavement was slick, a mirror of dark oil and city lights. She ran until her lungs felt like they were filled with broken glass, her expensive silk heels clattering against the indifferent stone.

她的呼吸变得凌乱且灼热。柏油路面湿滑如镜，倒映着黑色油脂与城市灯光。她不停地跑，直到肺部感觉像是填满了碎玻璃，昂贵的丝绸高跟鞋在冷漠的石板路上发出凌乱的脆响。

The "Last Line of Defense" was sprinting toward a void. She had no destination, only a desperate need to outrun the sound of her father’s voice selling her soul.

“最后的防线”正奔向虚无。她没有目的地，只有一种绝望的渴望：逃离父亲出卖她灵魂的那个声音。

Part 2: The Black Umbrella

黑色的伞

A pair of headlights cut through the gloom, blinding her. Miyetsuko stumbled, her foot catching on a jagged edge of the curb. She waited for the impact of the wet asphalt, but it never came.

一对大灯刺破了阴霾，晃得她睁不开眼。美悦子踉跄了一下，脚尖绊在了路边石的锯齿状边缘上。她等待着撞向湿冷沥青路面的冲击，但那一刻并未到来。

Instead, a hand caught her upper arm—firm, steady, and terrifyingly calm. A black umbrella blossomed over her head like a dark flower, shielding her from the vertical assault of the storm.

相反，一只手抓住了她的上臂——有力、平稳，且冷静得令人恐惧。一把黑伞在她头顶如暗之花般绽开，为她挡住了暴雨的垂直侵袭。

"It’s a long way to nowhere, Miyetsuko-sama," a voice murmured.

“美悦子大人，通往‘无处’的路可是很长的，”一个声音低声呢喃。

She looked up, rain dripping from her eyelashes like tears she refused to shed. Hasegawa Makoto stood there, his face half-hidden in the shadows of the silk canopy. He looked like an apparition conjured from the very darkness she was trying to flee.

她抬起头，雨水从睫毛上滴落，像她拒绝流出的泪。长谷川诚站在那里，脸庞半掩在丝绒伞盖的阴影中。他看起来像是一个从她正试图逃离的黑暗中幻化出来的幽灵。

Part 3: The Scent of the Weaver

织网者的气息

He didn't wait for her permission. He stripped off his heavy wool overcoat and draped it over her trembling shoulders. The fabric was warm, smelling of expensive tobacco and a faint, lingering musk that her innocent mind couldn't identify—the ghost of Saori’s skin.

他没有征求她的许可，直接脱下厚重的羊毛大衣，披在她颤抖的肩膀上。大衣是暖的，带着昂贵烟草的味道，还有一种淡淡的、挥之不去的麝香气息，她天真的头脑无法辨识那是什么——那是沙织皮肤留下的余温。

"How... how did you find me?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the rain.

“你……你怎么找到我的？”她低声问道，声音在暴雨的轰鸣中微弱得几乎听不见。

"I told you," Makoto said, his thumb brushing a stray, wet lock of hair from her forehead. His touch was electric, a predatory tenderness. "I'm listening to your heart. It’s beating very loudly right now. It sounds like a bird hitting the bars of its cage."

“我告诉过你，”诚说道，拇指掠过她额前一缕湿乱的发丝。他的触碰带着电流，那是一种掠食者般的温柔。“我在倾听你的心声。它现在跳得很响，听起来像一只正在撞击笼栏的鸟。”

He leaned closer, his eyes reflecting the cold, digital precision she had seen in the van, though she didn't know it yet. "The Kurosaki betrothal is a death sentence, Miyetsuko. But I can offer you a different kind of cage. One where you can at least keep your piano."

他凑得更近，眼中闪烁着她在车厢内（尽管她还不知道）见过的那种冷酷的数字精度。“黑崎家的婚约是死刑，美悦子。但我可以为你提供另一种笼子。至少在那儿，你能留住你的钢琴。”

Part 4: The Surrender in the Dark

黑暗中的投降

Miyetsuko looked at the black Mercedes idling at the curb, its exhaust curling like a dragon’s breath in the cold air. She looked at the man who seemed to know her secrets before she even spoke them.

美悦子看着停在路边的黑色奔驰，排气管排出的废气在冷空气中像龙息一样盘旋。她看着这个似乎在她开口之前就已知晓她所有秘密的男人。

She was a girl raised on fairy tales and tactical marriages, but nothing had prepared her for a savior who smelled like a predator. She took a step toward the car, the platinum leash around her neck—his gift—pulsing with a hidden, green light in the shadows.

她是一个在童话和策略婚姻中长大的女孩，但没有任何事能让她准备好面对一个带着掠食者气息的救星。她朝车子迈出了一步，颈间那条铂金枷锁——他的礼物——在阴影中闪烁着隐秘的绿光。

"Take me away," she whispered, grabbing the lapel of his coat as if it were a lifeline. "Just... take me away."

“带我走，”她抓着他大衣的翻领，仿佛那是最后一根救命稻草，低声呢喃道。“只要……带我走就好。”

Makoto smiled, a small, triumphant curve that didn't reach his eyes. He opened the door for her, ushering the swan into the velvet darkness of his world.

诚笑了，那是抹并没到达眼底的、小小的胜利弧度。他为她打开车门，引导这只天鹅步入他世界那丝绒般的黑暗之中。
