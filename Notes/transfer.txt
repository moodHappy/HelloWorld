Lena’s Apartment — Evening Light

莉娜的公寓 · 傍晚的光


---

Lena came home later than usual that evening.
那天傍晚，莉娜回家得比平时晚。

The stairwell lights were already on, casting a yellow glow that made everything look older than it was.
楼道的灯已经亮起，昏黄的光让一切看上去都比实际更旧。

She paused on the third floor, not because she was tired, but because someone was standing below, searching for keys.
她在三楼停了一下，不是因为累了，而是因为下面有人正低头找钥匙。

The man muttered under his breath, patting his coat pockets, then his bag.
那男人低声嘀咕着，拍了拍外套口袋，又翻了翻包。

Lena watched without moving.
莉娜站着没动。

There had been a time when she would have offered help.
曾经，她是会出声帮忙的。

Now she waited for things to resolve themselves.
现在，她更习惯等事情自己结束。

After a minute, the man straightened, keys finally in hand, relief crossing his face.
过了一会儿，男人直起身，终于找到了钥匙，脸上掠过一丝轻松。

He glanced up and noticed her.
他抬头，看见了她。

“Evening,” he said, as if they were already acquainted.
“晚上好。”他说，语气像是他们早就认识。

“Evening,” Lena replied, neutral and brief.
“晚上好。”莉娜回应，平静而简短。

They passed each other on the stairs without slowing down.
他们在楼梯上擦肩而过，没有放慢脚步。

Only when she reached her apartment did Lena realize she had been holding her breath.
直到走进公寓，莉娜才意识到自己刚才一直屏着呼吸。

She set her bag down, turned on the lamp, and let the room fill with a softer light.
她放下包，打开台灯，让更柔和的光填满房间。

Whatever the man had needed, he had managed on his own.
不管那男人需要什么，他已经自己解决了。

This, she told herself, was how things worked now.
她对自己说，现在事情就是这样运转的。
