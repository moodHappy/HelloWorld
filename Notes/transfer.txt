Chapter 30: The Heat in the Elevator

第三十章：电梯里的热度

They walked out of the chaotic club, leaving a room full of stunned gangsters.

他们走出混乱的俱乐部，留下一屋子目瞪口呆的黑帮分子。

They got into the private elevator that led to the roof.

他们进了通往屋顶的私人电梯。

As soon as the doors closed, the mask dropped.

门一关上，面具就摘下了。

Miyetsuko slumped against the wall, letting out a breath she had been holding for an hour. Her legs were trembling slightly.

美悦子瘫靠在墙上，吐出一口憋了一个小时的气。她的腿在微微发抖。

"Did you see his face?" she laughed, a nervous, high-pitched sound. "When you broke his finger... god, Chen. That was..."

“你看到他的脸了吗？”她笑了，那是紧张、尖锐的声音。“当你折断他手指的时候……天啊，陈。那真是……”

She grabbed Chen Mo's tie and pulled him close.

她抓住陈默的领带，把他拉近。

"That was so hot."

“太性感了。”

Chen Mo didn't speak. He pushed her against the mirrored wall of the elevator. His hands found the high slits of her Qipao, sliding up her thighs instantly.

陈默没说话。他把她推到电梯的镜面墙上。他的手找到了旗袍的高开叉，瞬间滑上她的大腿。

"You played a dangerous game," he muttered, his fingers gripping her soft flesh possessively. "If they had decided to shoot..."

“你玩了个危险的游戏，”他低声说，手指占有欲极强地抓着她柔软的肉。“如果他们决定开枪……”

"They didn't," she gasped, arching into his touch. "Because you were there. My wolf."

“他们没有，”她喘息着，迎合着他的触碰。“因为你在那儿。我的狼。”

She lifted her leg, wrapping it around his waist. The black silk bunching up at her waist revealed she wasn't wearing anything underneath the Qipao.

她抬起腿，缠在他的腰上。黑色丝绸在腰间堆积，暴露出她在旗袍下面什么都没穿。

"You wore this... commando? To a meeting with gangsters?" Chen Mo's eyes darkened.

“你穿成这样……真空？去见那群黑帮？”陈默的眼神暗了下来。

"I knew it would distract you," she bit his lip. "I wanted you to think about this... while you were breaking fingers."

“我知道这会让你分心，”她咬住他的嘴唇。“我想让你一边折断手指……一边想着这个。”

The elevator dinged. They were on the roof. But neither moved.

电梯叮了一声。到了屋顶。但两人都没动。

"Don't stop," she whispered, her hands clawing at his back. "Right here. In the elevator. Before the doors open."

“别停，”她低语，双手在他背上抓挠。“就在这儿。电梯里。在门开之前。”

Chen Mo pressed the emergency stop button.

陈默按下了紧急停止按钮。

In the suspended steel box, high above the violent city, the Queen and her Knight engaged in a battle of their own—a battle of sweat, silk, and desperate need.

在这个悬挂在暴力城市上空的钢铁盒子里，女王和她的骑士开始了属于他们自己的战斗——一场关于汗水、丝绸和绝望需求的战斗。
