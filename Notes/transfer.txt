There is a big fire at the New World store in Auckland, New Zealand. Firefighters work many hours. They stop the fire.

People build new things in the store. There is a new place for online shopping. The fire starts in the top part of the store. We do not know the reason. The building has a lot of damage.

Some people are looking at the store now. They must say if it is possible to fix the building or make a new one. In another place, in Christchurch, a new big store is coming. It has a big water tank for fire.

Difficult words: firefighter (a person who stops fires), damage (bad change to something), tank (a big container for water or other liquid).
