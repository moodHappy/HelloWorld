Chapter 9: The Reality Call

第九章：现实的来电

The buzzing in her pocket was like an electric shock. Miyetsuko stiffened, pulling away from Shiraishi’s embrace. She checked the screen: Mom. The name felt like a heavy weight. The intimacy of the last few minutes evaporated, replaced by a cold, familiar dread.

兜里的震动声像是一记电击。美悦子身体一僵，从白石的怀抱中挣脱出来。她看了眼屏幕：妈妈。这个名字此刻沉重得压人。过去几分钟的亲昵感瞬间蒸发，取而代之的是一种冰冷而熟悉的恐惧。

"Where are you? You’ve been gone for a while," her mother’s voice was thin and tired over the line. Miyetsuko took a deep breath, smoothing her messy hair with one hand. "I’m just leaving the store, Mom. I ran into a classmate and we started talking about the mock exams. I’m on my way back now."

“你在哪儿？去了好一阵子了，”电话那头母亲的声音听起来又轻又疲惫。美悦子深吸了一口气，一只手理着乱糟糟的头发。“刚出店门，妈。碰到了个同学，聊了几句模拟考的事。我现在就往回走。”

She hung up and looked at Shiraishi. The thrill was gone, leaving only the chill of the night air. "I really have to go," she said, her voice turning back into that cool, detached mask. She straightened her sweater, making sure no skin was showing. Shiraishi watched her, his eyes dark. He didn't stop her this time.

她挂掉电话看向白石。那种刺激感消失了，只剩下夜晚空气的寒意。“我真的得走了，”她说，声音重新变回了那种冷淡、疏离的伪装。她拉平毛衣，确保没露出一丁点皮肤。白石看着她，眼神深邃，这次没有拦她。

"Don't run," Shiraishi called out softly as she started to walk away. "You'll look too suspicious if you're out of breath." Miyetsuko didn't turn back, but she slowed her pace. She had to transition from the girl in the photo back to the perfect daughter before she reached her front door.

“别用跑的，”她走开时，白石在身后轻声提醒，“要是喘得太厉害，会显得很可疑。”美悦子没回头，但放慢了脚步。在踏进家门前，她必须从照片里那个女孩，重新变回那个完美的女儿。
