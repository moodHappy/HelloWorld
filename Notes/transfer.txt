She walked ahead of me with a small black suitcase.

I had imagined this trip many times, but the street looked ordinary.

The hotel stood beside a convenience store and a closed bakery.

She checked the booking on her phone at the front desk.

她在前台用手机确认预订信息。

The clerk said only one room was left because of a conference.

She paused for two seconds and then nodded.

I kept my eyes on the floor tiles and said nothing.

The room had two narrow beds pushed close together.

A single window faced the parking lot behind the building.

She put her suitcase near the wall and took off her coat.

I placed my bag beside the desk and waited for instructions.

She said we should review the client files before dinner.

We sat at the small table with our shoulders almost touching.

Her voice stayed calm while she explained the schedule.

I wrote notes slowly to hide my nervous hands.

我写得很慢，好让发抖的手不被看见。

When she leaned over to point at a line, her hair brushed my sleeve.

她俯身指文件时，头发擦过我的袖子。

Neither of us mentioned it, and she continued speaking.

我们都没有提起，她继续往下说。

After the meeting plan was finished, she closed the folder.

计划讲完后，她把文件夹合上。

She asked if I wanted noodles or rice for dinner.

We bought two simple meals from the shop downstairs.

Back in the room, the television played low news sounds.

回到房间，电视里放着很小声的新闻。

She sat on her bed to answer work messages.

I stood by the window and watched cars leave the parking lot.

The room grew quiet after ten o’clock.

十点以后房间慢慢安静下来。

She turned off the main light and kept the desk lamp on.

她关掉顶灯，只留下一盏台灯。

Soft yellow light covered half of her face.

柔黄的灯光落在她半边脸上。

She said we needed to wake up at six.

I said I understood and lay down on my bed.

我说知道了，然后躺到自己的床上。

The distance between the two beds was less than one step.

I could hear her breathing after the lamp was turned off.

No one spoke again before sleep came.
