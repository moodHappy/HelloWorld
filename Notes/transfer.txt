Donald Tusk is Polandâ€™s prime minister. He wants to make Poland better. He asks the parliament to show if they help him. Many people in parliament say yes.

There is a new president in Poland. His name is Karol Nawrocki. He does not agree with Tusk. He can stop new laws, which is a problem for Tusk. He wants to make changes, but the president can say no.

Tusk needs to talk to people in a new way. He wants more people to help him.

The European Union likes Tusk. They want Poland to stay with the EU. But it is hard if Tusk and the president do not agree.
