The Message

She stared at the message again: Did you talk to him yet? Her thumb hovered over the screen, but she couldn’t bring herself to reply.

It wasn’t about the man in the elevator. Not exactly. It was about someone else—the reason she’d taken this hotel at all.

Two days ago, she had been at the café near the train station, sipping bitter coffee and scrolling through news. That’s when she saw him: tall, hunched over a laptop, fingers moving fast, a wedding ring glinting in the sunlight. He looked familiar, though she couldn’t place him at first. Then she remembered.

College. She had loved him once. Not the way people talk about love in novels—messy, infuriating, endless—but the way people love for a season and let it fade. She had left town; he had left her behind. And now, by some cruel coincidence, they were in the same city again.

The message was from her friend Mara. Did you talk to him yet?
Mara knew everything: where he lived, his habits, the coffee shop he went to every morning. She had suggested this “coincidental” meeting. Not that she had asked for it. Or maybe she had.

She had resisted at first. She told herself she didn’t care. That she wanted nothing but anonymity, the hotel, the groceries. And yet, every time she thought of him, the words Mara had sent made her pulse quicken.

So she came. She rented a room on the sixth floor, a place cheap enough that she could leave early without a fuss. She imagined him walking past the elevator, imagining the same hotel, the same hallways. Maybe he’d notice her. Maybe he wouldn’t.

When the elevator hummed upward yesterday, she hadn’t expected him to be there. Yet there he was, a ghost from another life, looking tired, distracted. She had wanted to say something, anything, but the words wouldn’t come. He was just a stranger, and she was just another guest.

That night, she remembered the message. Did you talk to him yet? She hadn’t. She wouldn’t. The conversation she imagined in her head was perfect: words balanced, smiles exchanged, closure found. The reality, she knew, would be messy and cruel.

This morning, she left the hotel, arms free for the first time in days. She never replied to Mara. The bus waited, humming softly as it idled, the city stretching out in front of her. Some meetings, she realized, were meant to happen only in memory. Some messages were meant never to be answered.

And some people, no matter how close they had been, belonged to another time.

She slipped the phone into her pocket.

Some stories weren’t meant to be reopened.
