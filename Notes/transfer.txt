Chapter 20: The Cold Safe House

第二十章：冰冷的安全屋

Location: A minimalist concrete apartment in the Minato ward. This was one of Miyetsuko's secret properties.

地点：港区一间极简主义的混凝土公寓。这是美悦子的秘密房产之一。

Chen Mo sat on the sofa, shivering. He had wrapped his wounds, but the cold from the liquid nitrogen still seemed to be in his bones. On the coffee table in front of him sat the bloodstained USB drive.

陈默坐在沙发上，浑身发抖。虽然包扎了伤口，但液氮的寒气似乎还在骨头里。面前的茶几上，放着那个沾血的U盘。

The door opened.

门开了。

Miyetsuko walked in. She had changed out of her trench coat into a white silk robe. She didn't bring cash, nor a car. She brought a bottle of expensive whiskey and two glasses.

美悦子走了进来。她换下了风衣，穿着一件白色的丝绸睡袍。她没带现金，也没带车。她带了一瓶昂贵的威士忌，和两个杯子。

She didn't look like a woman who was threatened. She looked like she was attending a funeral—solemn, yet breathtakingly beautiful.

她看起来不像个被威胁的女人。她看起来像是在参加一场葬礼——庄重，却美得惊心动魄。

"You're late," Chen Mo stared at her, his hand reaching for the fruit knife on the table.

“你迟到了。”陈默盯着她，手摸向桌上的水果刀。

"I had to shake off the tails," Miyetsuko poured the wine calmly, the amber liquid swirling in the glass. "Put down the knife, Chen Mo. If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have come alone."

“我得甩掉尾巴。”美悦子平静地倒酒，琥珀色的液体在杯中旋转。“放下刀，陈默。如果我想让你死，我就不会一个人来了。”

"Explain," Chen Mo's voice was like ice. "Why did you try to kill me? Why purge the server? You said you wanted the list."

“解释。”陈默的声音像冰一样。“为什么要杀我？为什么要清洗服务器？你说过你要那份名单。”

Miyetsuko walked over, placed the glass in front of him, and then sat down directly on the coffee table, facing him. Her robe parted slightly, revealing those pale, smooth legs, but her eyes were sharp as a blade.

美悦子走过来，把酒杯放在他面前，然后直接坐在了茶几上，面对着他。睡袍微微敞开，露出苍白光洁的小腿，但她的眼神却像刀锋一样锐利。

"You idiot. Do you think Kurosaki's core database is a public library where you can just copy and paste?"

“你这个蠢货。你以为黑崎的核心数据库是公共图书馆，随手就能复制粘贴吗？”

She took a sip of whiskey, her red lips stained with liquor, looking dangerous and mocking.

她抿了一口威士忌，红唇染上了酒液，看起来危险又嘲讽。

"That server has a 'Dead Man's Switch.' If anyone tries to copy the 'Arms List' directly, the data instantly encrypts itself into gibberish and locks down. The ONLY way to extract it... is to force the system into 'Emergency Purge Mode'."

“那个服务器有‘死手开关’。如果有人试图直接复制‘军火名单’，数据会瞬间加密成乱码并锁定。想要提取它的唯一办法……就是逼迫系统进入‘紧急清洗模式’。”
