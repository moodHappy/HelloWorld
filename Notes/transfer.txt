The lads at Westfield High were proper fed up when the school banned short skirts. So last Monday, they came up with a brilliant plan. In protest, about thirty of them showed up wearing Japanese-style school uniforms—the girls' ones! Complete with pleated skirts and knee socks. The headmaster nearly fainted!
西菲尔德高中的男生们对学校禁止短裙的规定彻底不满。于是上周一，他们想出了一个绝妙的计划。作为抗议，大约三十个男生穿着日本式的女生校服出现了！配齐百褶裙和及膝袜。校长差点当场晕倒！

"We're showing how ridiculous this rule is," said Tom, one of the boys. The protest went viral, with students from other schools joining in.
“我们是要让大家看看这条规定有多荒唐。”其中一名男生汤姆说道。这场抗议迅速走红，其他学校的学生也纷纷加入。

By Friday, the school had reversed the ban. "Fair's fair," the principal admitted. The boys celebrated by changing back into their regular trousers. Well done, lads!
到了周五，学校终于撤销了禁令。“公平就是公平。”校长承认。男生们换回常规的长裤庆祝。干得漂亮，兄弟们！
