Futility

Mark spent three months fixing a clock no one used.

It hung on the wall of a small bus station café, right above the menu that hadn’t changed since 2012. The clock had stopped at 6:40 long before Mark started working there, frozen like it was making a point.

“Don’t bother with it,” his boss, Helen, said on his first day. “Everyone checks their phones.”

Mark nodded, but the silence of that dead clock bothered him. Every tick that never came felt wrong.

So after closing time, he stayed.

He brought in a screwdriver from home. Then a magnifying glass. Then a tiny bottle of oil. Each night, he opened the clock, adjusted something, put it back, and waited.

Sometimes it moved. Once, it ran for almost a whole hour before stopping again.

Mark smiled that night like he’d won something.

During the day, life went on as usual. Commuters rushed in, ordered coffee, complained about delays. Someone always asked, “Is this the last bus?” Someone was always late anyway.

Nobody noticed the clock.

One afternoon, a man in a wrinkled coat stared at it and said, “That thing’s been wrong for years.”

Mark said, “I’m working on it.”

The man laughed. “Why?”

Mark didn’t answer.

Weeks passed. The seasons shifted slightly—less light in the evenings, colder wind sneaking through the door. Mark’s hands smelled permanently of metal and oil.

One night, after a long shift, he finally heard it.

Tick.

Tick.

The clock moved steadily, confidently, as if it had never been broken.

Mark sat under it, watching the second hand circle again and again. He checked his phone. The time matched perfectly.

He felt absurdly proud.

The next morning, the café was louder than usual. Helen was arguing with a technician.

“They’re replacing it,” she said when she saw Mark. “New digital display. Comes with the renovation.”

The old clock lay on the counter, face cracked, battery removed.

Mark stared at it. “It was working,” he said.

Helen shrugged. “Didn’t need it.”

That night, Mark took the clock home. He hung it above his desk. It ticked faithfully, keeping perfect time in a room where no one ever asked for it.

Weeks later, it stopped again.

Mark replaced the battery. Cleaned the gears. Adjusted the hands.

It didn’t start.

He sat there for a long time, then quietly put the clock in a drawer.

The next morning, he woke up late, rushed out the door, and checked his phone for the time—like everyone else.
