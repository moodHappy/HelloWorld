Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez will get married in Venice. They first want to have a party in a busy area, but move it to a quiet place because of safety and protests.

The new place is called the Arsenal. There is water around it. It is hard to get there when bridges are up. About 200 – 250 guests will come. The wedding is secret, but the party will be on Saturday. The event may cost around 46 – 55 million dollars. Bezos will give money to help Venice. Many guests are arriving in private jets. Some famous people, like Ivanka Trump, are already in Venice. Some people are not happy. They say that Venice is a fun park for rich people.
