"Attorney Dong, I totally panicked! I hit this guy and he literally flew like ten feet in the air! I blinked and poof! He was gone! Does that count as hit-and-run if I can't find the victim? I've been looking behind bushes, in trees, even asked a squirrel if he saw anything. The squirrel just gave me this judgmental look. Now I'm talking to you while hiding in my car. Should I call the police or wait for him to... you know... land somewhere? This is way worse than when I hit that golf ball that one time!"
