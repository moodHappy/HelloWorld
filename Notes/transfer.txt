Chapter 2: The Walk Home

第二章：回家路上

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the pavement, and a light evening breeze carried away the last of the day’s lingering heat. Miyetsuko walked ahead, her pace steady and unhurried. The sticky sensation at the top of her thighs hadn't faded yet; every step was a sharp reminder of the madness back in that bathroom stall. She tilted her head slightly, catching a glimpse of Shiraishi in her periphery. He looked completely refreshed, like an engine that had just been refueled.

夕阳把两人的影子拉得很长，晚风一吹，带走了一点残留的燥热。美悦子走在前面，步子迈得不紧不慢，大腿根部那种黏腻的触感还没完全消散，每走一步都在提醒她刚才在隔间里的疯狂。她微微侧过头，余光瞥了一眼走在身边的白石修——这家伙倒是神清气爽，像个刚加满油的发动机。

They had been dating for three months, and Shiraishi’s energy was almost inhuman. These "after-school sessions" had become a daily fixture. Miyetsuko looked down. The fabric at the top of her school blouse clung to her skin with an unnatural dampness. That small patch of fabric had hardened as it dried, rubbing against her tender nipples—cold and itchy.

交往三个月，白石的精力旺盛得简直不像人类。每天放学，这种“加餐”几乎成了固定项目。美悦子低下头，校服衬衫最上方的布料贴在皮肤上，透着一股不自然的潮意。那一小块布料干涸后变得有些发硬，磨着她娇嫩的乳尖，又凉又痒。

"Tch." She knit her brows. She had forgotten to bring a spare undershirt today. In her current state, while the stains on the shirt weren't obvious, that musky, sweet scent would be impossible to hide in the quiet of the entryway. She could already see it: bumping into her parents the second she walked in, the air turning more suffocating than it had been in the bathroom.

“啧。”她眉头轻蹙。今天出门的时候，居然把备用的那件白吊带给忘了。现在这副样子，衬衫上的污渍虽然不明显，但那股腥甜的气息在安静的玄关里简直无所遁形。她几乎能预见到，如果一进门就撞见父母，那种紧绷的空气会比刚才在厕所里还要让人窒息。

Shiraishi leaned in, reaching for her hand, but Miyetsuko subtly dodged him. "Shiraishi," she said, eyes fixed forward, her voice cold but provocative. "Next time you get it on my clothes, you can be the one to explain it to my mom."

白石修凑过来，想去牵她的手，被美悦子不动声色地躲开了。“白石，”她目视前方，声音冷淡却带着钩子，“下次再弄到衣服上，你就自己去跟我妈解释。”
