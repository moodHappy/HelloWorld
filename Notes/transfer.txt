Chapter 1: Escaping the Noise
第一章：逃离分贝
When the high-speed train left the city behind like an old coat, Chen Mo let out a long sigh.
高铁把城市像一件旧衣服一样甩在身后的时候，陈默长长地舒了一口气。
The scenery outside the window shifted from gray concrete forests to rolling indigo mountains. He had spent three years in Tokyo like a pressure cooker, squeezed into the morning commute like a can of sardines, ears constantly filled with the endless clatter of keyboards and his boss’s shouting. This vacation was less a trip and more an escape.
车窗外的景色从灰色的水泥森林变成了连绵起伏的黛色山脉。他在东京这种高压锅里煮了整整三年，每天被早高峰的地铁挤压成罐头，耳边永远是那永无止境的键盘敲击声和上司的咆哮。这次请年假，与其说是旅行，不如说是一场逃亡。
He chose a little-known hot spring town deep in the Izu Peninsula. There were no overdeveloped commercial streets, only a few Showa-style inns with old lanterns hanging outside.
他选择的目的地是伊豆半岛深处一个鲜为人知的温泉小镇。这里没有过度开发的商业街，只有几家挂着旧灯笼的昭和风民宿。
When he arrived at the “Yunyin” inn, it was drizzling. The landlady, a warm elderly woman, led him along the creaking wooden corridor. The room was small but quiet; sliding open the door, he saw a stream flowing gently outside and mountains covered in red leaves.
到达“云隐”旅馆时，天空正飘着细雨。老板娘是个热情的老太太，领着他穿过吱呀作响的木走廊。房间不大，但胜在清净，推开拉门，外面就是一条潺潺流过的溪流和满山的红叶。
After dinner, Chen Mo changed into a yukata and went to the outdoor bath. Being a quiet Tuesday in the off-season, he was the only person in the men’s bath. He closed his eyes in the steaming water, feeling the exhaustion in his bones slowly being drawn out.
晚饭后，陈默换上浴衣，打算去露天风吕泡一泡。因为是淡季的周二，整个男汤只有他一个人。他在热气腾腾的水中闭上眼，感觉骨头缝里的疲惫正一点点被抽离。
Later, when he bought a can of chilled milk at the front lounge, he met her.
就在他泡完澡，在前厅的休息区买了一罐冰牛奶时，他遇到了那个女人。
