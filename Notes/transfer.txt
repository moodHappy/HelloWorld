Chapter 3: The Drone in the Sunset

第三章：夕阳下的无人机

Just as Chen Mo leaned down to lick the melted ice water off her stomach, a buzzing sound caught his ear.

就在陈默俯身准备舔掉她肚子上的冰水时，一阵嗡嗡声引起了他的注意。

It wasn't a mosquito. It was mechanical.

不是蚊子。是机械声。

He looked up. A small black dot was hovering against the blinding sun, about 500 meters away.

他抬头。一个黑点悬停在刺眼的阳光下，大约500米远。

"Don't move," Chen Mo's voice dropped an octave. The playfulness vanished.

“别动，”陈默的声音低了八度。玩笑意消失了。

"What is it? Paparazzi?" Miyetsuko didn't open her eyes, enjoying his breath on her skin.

“什么东西？狗仔队？”美悦子没睁眼，享受着他皮肤上的气息。

"Too stable for a paparazzi drone. That's a military-grade spotter. MQ-19."

“对于狗仔队的无人机来说太稳了。那是军用级的侦察机。MQ-19。”

Chen Mo grabbed a towel and threw it over Miyetsuko.

陈默抓起一条毛巾扔在美悦子身上。

"Cover up. We are being watched."

“盖好。我们在被监视。”

Miyetsuko sat up, pulling the towel around her shoulders. The thrill in her eyes was palpable. It wasn't fear; it was excitement.

美悦子坐起来，把毛巾裹在肩上。她眼中的兴奋显而易见。那不是恐惧；是兴奋。

"Kurosaki found us?"

“黑崎找到我们了？”

"Took him long enough," Chen Mo picked up the silenced pistol from the table. He aimed at the sun.

“他花的时间够久的，”陈默拿起桌上的消音手枪。他瞄准太阳。

Pffft.

噗。

The black dot in the sky wobbled, smoked, and spiraled down into the jungle below.

天空中的黑点晃动了一下，冒烟，然后螺旋坠入下方的丛林。

"He sent a scout," Chen Mo checked the magazine. "Which means the hit team is already in Rio."

“他派了侦察兵，”陈默检查弹夹。“这意味着杀手小组已经在里约了。”

Miyetsuko stood up. The gold bikini flashed under the towel.

美悦子站起身。金色比基尼在毛巾下若隐若现。

"Finally," she stretched, cracking her neck. "I was getting sick of just shooting watermelons. Tonight's party just got interesting."

“终于，”她伸了个懒腰，脖子发出咔咔声。“我都快厌倦只射西瓜了。今晚的派对变得有趣了。”

"We are walking into a trap if we go to that party," Chen Mo warned.

“如果我们去那个派对，就是走进陷阱，”陈默警告道。

"No, Chen," she walked past him, her hips swaying with a deadly rhythm. "We are walking into a hunting ground. And I intend to be the one eating tonight."

“不，陈，”她走过他身边，臀部以一种致命的节奏摇摆。“我们是走进猎场。而我打算做今晚进食的那一个。”
