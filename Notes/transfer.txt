Chapter 15: The Collision of Softness and Greed

第十五章：柔软与贪婪的碰撞

Through the rain-streaked window, Chen Mo watched Miyetsuko stagger towards the guard booth.

透过满是雨痕的车窗，陈默看着美悦子跌跌撞撞地走向保安岗亭。

She was acting superbly. Her footsteps were messy, her body swaying, looking exactly like a wealthy wife who had drunk too much at a party and lost her way.

她的演技太好了。脚步凌乱，身体摇晃，活脱脱一个在宴会上喝多了、迷了路的富家太太。

The guard was a middle-aged fat man, bored and dozing off. He was startled awake by the banging on the window.

保安是个中年的胖子，正百无聊赖地打瞌睡。被敲窗声惊醒后，他一脸不耐烦地推开门。

"Help... I can't find my driver..." Miyetsuko's voice, mixed with the rain, sounded fragile and sticky.

“救命……我找不到我的司机了……”美悦子的声音夹杂在雨声里，听起来脆弱又黏腻。

Before the guard could react, she "accidentally" slipped.

没等保安反应过来，她脚下“不小心”一滑。

"Ah!"

“啊！”

The fat guard instinctively reached out to catch her. And in that instant, a "catastrophe" happened.

胖保安本能地伸手去扶。而在那一瞬间，“灾难”发生了。

She fell completely into his arms. The trench coat loosened "accidentally," and that terrifyingly heavy, soft chest pressed firmly against the guard's arm.

她整个人跌进了保安怀里。风衣的领口“意外”松开，那恐怖的、沉甸甸的胸口结结实实地压在了保安的手臂上。

Chen Mo, watching from afar, felt his blood boil. He saw the guard's body stiffen instantly, like being struck by lightning.

远处的陈默觉得血往头上涌。他看到那个保安的身体瞬间僵硬，像被雷劈了一样。

"I'm so dizzy... let me lean for a bit..." Miyetsuko didn't get up immediately. Instead, she practically buried the guard's face in her neck.

“我好晕……让我靠一会儿……”美悦子没有立刻起来，反而几乎把保安的脸埋进了自己的颈窝里。

The overwhelming scent of a mature woman, the warmth of the rain-soaked skin, and the astonishing, suffocating softness that engulfed his arm—it was too much for a lonely night shift guard.

那种铺天盖地的熟女香气，雨水打湿后的皮肤热度，还有那吞没了他手臂的、惊人的窒息般的柔软——这对一个寂寞的夜班保安来说，是核弹级别的冲击。

"Madam... you... come into the room to rest..." The guard's voice was trembling, filled with greedy saliva sounds. He half-carried, half-hugged Miyetsuko, practically dragging her towards the duty room, completely forgetting the monitors behind him.

“夫人……您……进屋休息……”保安的声音都在发抖，充满了贪婪的口水声。他半扶半抱着美悦子，几乎是拖着她往值班室里走，完全忘记了身后的监控。

The moment the duty room door closed, Chen Mo saw Miyetsuko's hand behind her back, making an "OK" gesture.

在值班室门关上的那一刹那，陈默看到美悦子背在身后的手，比了一个“OK”的手势。

He gritted his teeth, pushed open the car door, and dashed into the rain like a cheetah.

他咬着牙，推开车门，像猎豹一样冲进了雨里。
