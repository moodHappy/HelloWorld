The Vegetarian

Liu Wen became a vegetarian on a Tuesday, quietly, without telling anyone.

That morning, she opened the fridge and stared at a pack of pork ribs she had bought the night before. They were still pink, neatly cut, waiting to be cooked. She closed the fridge, poured herself some oatmeal, and ate it plain. No eggs. No milk. Just oats and hot water.

At lunch, her coworkers noticed first.

“You’re not eating the chicken?” Zhang asked, pointing at her lunchbox.

“I don’t want it anymore,” Liu Wen said. Her voice was calm, almost bored.

“Dieting?”

“No. Just don’t feel like eating meat.”

Zhang shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He bit into his drumstick.

That night, her husband noticed next.

At dinner, Liu Wen pushed the braised beef aside and picked at the vegetables.

“You sick?” he asked.

“No.”

“Then why aren’t you eating?”

“I’m a vegetarian now.”

He laughed, thinking she was joking. When she didn’t smile back, the laughter faded.

“Since when?”

“Since today.”

He frowned. “Did you read something online again?”

She didn’t answer.

At first, it seemed like a small change. She cooked separate dishes. She avoided restaurants that didn’t have vegetable options. Her husband complained, but not too loudly. Life went on.

But people don’t like changes they don’t understand.

Her mother called.

“I heard you stopped eating meat,” her mother said, alarmed. “Are you trying to ruin your health?”

“I’m fine.”

“Women need nutrition. Protein. Iron.”

“I eat beans. Tofu.”

“That’s not the same.”

At a family dinner, her uncle joked loudly, “So you’re saving animals now?”

Liu Wen kept eating her rice.

“No,” she said. “I’m just choosing what goes into my body.”

The table went quiet.

What no one knew was that nothing dramatic had happened.

No nightmare. No trauma. No sudden revelation.

She was just tired.

Tired of chewing without tasting.
Tired of meals eaten out of habit.
Tired of doing things because “everyone does.”

Meat had simply become the clearest thing she could say no to.

At the supermarket, she moved past the meat counter without stopping. The smell that once meant dinner now meant nothing. She felt lighter—not physically, but mentally, as if one unnecessary decision had been removed from her life.

The real conflict came months later.

Her husband put a plate of pork in front of her one night.

“Just eat it,” he said. “This is getting ridiculous.”

“I won’t.”

“Why are you being so stubborn?”

She looked at him for a long time.

“Why does it bother you so much?” she asked.

He opened his mouth, then closed it.

Because her refusal felt like a quiet accusation.
Because her choice made his own look automatic.
Because it reminded him that life could be lived differently.

“I don’t know,” he said finally.

“I do,” she replied. “You think this is about food. It’s not.”

She stood up, cleared her bowl, and went to wash it.

Liu Wen never tried to convince anyone.

She didn’t preach.
She didn’t explain unless asked.
She didn’t make it a banner or a badge.

She just kept eating what felt right to her.

Years later, someone at work would ask, “Why did you become a vegetarian?”

She would smile slightly and say, “Because it was the first decision I made that was entirely my own.”

And for her, that was enough.
