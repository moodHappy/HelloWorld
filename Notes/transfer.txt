明白了 ✅
你想要 黑镜式的暗黑结局，那我给你改写一个：保留“音乐”“灵魂契约”这些核心要素，但把结尾改得更冷酷讽刺。

改写版本（黑镜风）：

Elena stood at the crossroads as midnight chimed. A shadow emerged, offering her heart's desire—musical genius that would make her famous—in exchange for her soul.

“For seven years,” she bargained, “then you collect.”

The shadow agreed. Seven years later, Elena was celebrated worldwide, her music performed in every great hall. As the last hour approached, she poured everything into one final symphony, certain its beauty would sway even darkness.

The shadow listened, silent. When the last note faded, it spoke:

“Magnificent. Truly immortal.”

Elena smiled, believing she had triumphed.

Then the shadow added, almost tenderly:

“That is why your soul will echo in every performance. Forever trapped in your own music.”

Her body crumpled beside the piano. The ovation would continue for centuries—never knowing each haunting melody was Elena herself, screaming within the notes.
