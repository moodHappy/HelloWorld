Maya lived in a world of silence. Since birth, she heard nothing but emptiness. One day, she decided to search for sound. She traveled through quiet forests and noiseless cities, her eyes scanning for vibrations her ears couldn't detect. At the beach, she placed her hands on the sand and felt the rhythm of waves. In a concert hall, she touched the piano as it played, feeling the music pulse through her fingers. Maya realized sound wasn't just heardâ€”it was felt, seen, and experienced. She had found her symphony in the silence, understanding that listening happens not just with ears, but with the heart.
