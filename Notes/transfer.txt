Ethan walked into the store and immediately spotted the T-shirt he had been eyeing for weeks—it had his favorite band's logo. He picked it up, imagining himself wearing it at the concert.  

<i>伊桑走进商店，立刻看到了自己暗暗关注了好几周的T恤——上面印着他最喜欢乐队的标志。他拿起它，幻想着自己在演唱会上穿着的样子。</i>

“How much is this T-shirt?” he asked.  

<i>“这件T恤多少钱？”他问道。</i>

The clerk looked down and said awkwardly, “Sorry, this T-shirt has been discontinued.”  

<i>店员低头尴尬地说：“抱歉，这件T恤已经停产了。”</i>

Ethan froze, staring at the empty rack. His heart sank, but he sighed and let it go. “Alright, next time I’ll be faster,” he said with a small smile.  

<i>伊桑愣住了，盯着空空的衣架。他心里有些失落，但叹了口气放下了T恤，嘴角仍带着微笑：“好吧，下次我会更快。”</i>
