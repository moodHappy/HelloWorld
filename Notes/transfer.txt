Chapter 39: The Favela Drift

第三十九章：贫民窟漂移

RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

哒-哒-哒-哒！

Bullets sparked off the rear armor of the Land Rover.

子弹在路虎的后装甲上擦出火花。

Behind them, three pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine guns were tearing through the narrow, winding streets of the Santa Teresa favela.

在他们身后，三辆架着重机枪的皮卡车正撕裂圣特雷莎贫民窟狭窄蜿蜒的街道。

"They want to play?" Miyetsuko's eyes shifted. The terror of the nightmare transformed instantly into rage. Pure, unadulterated combat rage. "Let's play."

“他们想玩？”美悦子的眼神变了。噩梦的恐惧瞬间转化成了愤怒。纯粹、毫无杂质的战斗怒火。

She slammed the gearshift. The heavy SUV drifted around a hairpin turn, the rear tires spinning on the wet cobblestones, inches from a 100-meter drop into the slums below.

她猛推档位。沉重的SUV在一个发卡弯处漂移，后轮在湿滑的鹅卵石上空转，离下方百米深的贫民窟只有几英寸。

"Target at 6 o'clock!" she yelled.

“目标6点钟方向！”她大喊。

Chen Mo leaned out the window. The wind whipped his hair. He aimed the MP5.

陈默探出窗外。风吹乱他的头发。他举起MP5瞄准。

He didn't spray and pray. He fired three controlled bursts.

他没有胡乱扫射。他打了三个精准的点射。

Pop-pop-pop.

砰-砰-砰。

The driver of the lead pickup truck jerked back, his head exploding. The truck swerved violently, crashing into a fruit stand and flipping over, blocking the narrow road for the others.

领头皮卡的司机猛地向后仰，脑袋炸开。皮卡剧烈转向，撞进一个水果摊后翻车，堵住了后面车辆的路。

"Nice shot," Miyetsuko laughed. It was a manic laugh. The adrenaline was washing away the memory of the white kimono. "But they have motorcycles coming from the alleyways!"

“打得好，”美悦子大笑。那是疯狂的笑声。肾上腺素正在冲刷掉白无垢的记忆。“但他们有摩托车从巷子里钻出来了！”
