Chapter 6: The Dead Groom

第六章：死去的准新郎

Part 1: The News at Dawn

黎明的消息

The sun hadn't fully risen when Ayaka’s phone buzzed on the coffee table. Miyetsuko, who hadn't slept a wink, watched the screen light up. It was a breaking news alert from a major tabloid.

当黎明的曙光还未完全升起时，绫香放在咖啡桌上的手机震动了起来。彻夜未眠的美悦子盯着屏幕亮起。那是一条来自主流小报的突发新闻。

"Kurosaki Group Heir Dies in High-Speed Crash."

“黑崎集团继承人死于超速车祸。”

The headline was accompanied by a blurry photo of a crushed red Lamborghini wrapped around a concrete pillar. The fire had been intense. There were no survivors.

标题下方配有一张模糊的照片，一辆撞得粉碎的红色兰博基尼缠绕在混凝土柱上。火势曾非常猛烈。无人生还。

Part 2: A Miracle or a Curse

神迹还是诅咒

Ayaka woke up and rubbed her eyes. She looked at the phone, then at Miyetsuko. "He’s dead? The guy you were supposed to marry... he’s just dead?"

绫香醒了过来，揉了揉眼睛。她看了看手机，又看了看美悦子。“他死了？那个你原本要嫁的男人……就这么死了？”

Miyetsuko felt a strange, cold wave wash over her. She should have felt horror, but all she felt was a sickening sense of relief. The contract that had been suffocating her was now a piece of paper signed with a dead man’s ghost.

美悦子感到一股奇异的冷意流遍全身。她本该感到惊恐，但她此时感到的只有一种令她作呕的解脱感。那份让她窒息的契约，现在成了一张与死者的亡灵签署的废纸。

"The engagement... it’s over," Miyetsuko whispered. "They can't sell me to a corpse."

“婚约……结束了，”美悦子低声说道。“他们不能把我卖给一个尸体。”

Part 3: The Father's Call

父亲的电话

Five minutes later, Miyetsuko’s own phone rang. It was her father. His voice, which had been full of desperation and rage the night before, was now trembling with a different kind of energy—relief masked as grief.

五分钟后，美悦子的手机响了。是她父亲。他的声音在前一晚还充满了绝望和愤怒，现在却带着一种不同的颤抖——那种掩饰在悲伤下的解脱。

"Miyetsuko? Come home," he said. "The tragedy at the Kurosaki house... it has changed everything. The creditors are backing off for a few days out of respect for their mourning. We have time now. The crisis is... paused."

“美悦子？回家吧，”他说。“黑崎家的悲剧……改变了一切。债权人为了表示对丧事的尊重，已经退后了几天。我们现在有时间了。危机……暂停了。”

He didn't sound like a man who had lost a future son-in-law. He sounded like a gambler who had just been given one more chip.

他听起来不像是失去了一个未来的女婿，倒像是个刚刚又得到一个筹码的赌徒。

Part 4: The Listener's Smile

倾听者的微笑

In the black van, Hasegawa Makoto leaned back in his chair. He had watched the news on a separate monitor before the tabloids even got hold of it. He listened to the relief in Miyetsuko’s voice through the platinum necklace.

黑色厢式车内，长谷川诚靠在椅子上。他在小报拿到消息之前，就已经在另一个监视器上看到了新闻。他通过那条铂金项链，倾听着美悦子声音里的解脱。

He didn't look disappointed. To a hunter, a frantic prey is difficult to catch, but a relieved prey is the easiest to trap.

他并没有显得失望。对于猎人来说，惊慌失措的猎物很难捕捉，但如释重负的猎物才是最容易落入陷阱的。

"Enjoy the morning, little swan," Makoto whispered to the empty air. "A pause isn't a rescue. It’s just a longer silence before the scream."

“享受这个早晨吧，小天鹅，”诚对着空气低声呢喃。“暂停并不等于获救。那只是尖叫前一段更长的沉默。”
