Chapter 47: The Anchor and the Chain

第四十七章：锚与链

Ten minutes later. The adrenaline began to fade, replaced by a darker, heavier hunger.

十分钟后。肾上腺素开始消退，取而代之的是一种更黑暗、更沉重的饥渴。

Chen Mo cut the engine to idle. The boat bobbed gently on the dark waves of the Pacific. The silence was deafening.

陈默把引擎切到怠速。船在太平洋黑暗的波浪上轻轻起伏。寂静震耳欲聋。

Miyetsuko was still straddling his lap. She lifted her head. Her hair was a mess of wet tangles. Her mascara had run slightly, giving her the look of a weeping widow, but her eyes were burning.

美悦子依然跨坐在他腿上。她抬起头。头发是一团湿漉漉的乱麻。睫毛膏微微晕染，让她看起来像个哭泣的寡妇，但她的眼睛在燃烧。

"We're alive," she whispered, touching Chen Mo's face with trembling fingers.

“我们活着，”她低声说，用颤抖的手指抚摸陈默的脸。

"Barely," Chen Mo's hands moved down her back, over the wet leather, gripping her hips.

“勉强活着，”陈默的手顺着她的背脊向下滑，滑过湿漉漉的皮革，抓住了她的臀部。

"The leather..." she shifted her weight, grinding against him. "It's chafing me. It's too tight. It hurts."

“这皮衣……”她挪动重心，在他身上研磨。“磨得我好痛。太紧了。好疼。”

"Take it off," Chen Mo commanded.
“脱掉，”陈默命令道。

Miyetsuko stood up unsteadily in the rocking boat. She grabbed the shoulders of the suit and peeled it down.

美悦子在摇晃的船上站得不稳。她抓住赛车服的肩膀，把它剥了下来。

The wet leather made a sucking sound as it left her skin.

湿皮衣离开皮肤时发出吸吮的声音。

She peeled it down to her waist, then kicked it off her ankles. She stood there in the moonlight, completely naked except for the gun holster on her thigh.

她把它剥到腰间，然后从脚踝踢掉。她站在月光下，除了大腿上的枪套，一丝不挂。

Her body was a masterpiece of survival. Pale, voluptuous, covered in red marks from the tight suit, bruises from the fight, and sweat. She looked like a primitive goddess of war and fertility.

她的身体是生存的杰作。苍白、丰腴，覆盖着紧身衣勒出的红痕、打斗留下的淤青，还有汗水。她看起来像一尊掌管战争与生育的原始女神。

"You drove well, my King," she knelt down on the seat, her knees spreading on either side of Chen Mo's legs. The moonlight turned the water droplets on her skin into pearls.

“车开得不错，我的国王，”她跪在座椅上，膝盖分在陈默双腿两侧。月光把她皮肤上的水珠变成了珍珠。

"But now," she leaned forward, her heavy breasts swaying gently with the boat's motion, brushing against Chen Mo's chest. "The engine is off. Who is going to drive me?"

“但现在，”她前倾身体，沉重的乳房随着船的晃动轻轻摇曳，擦过陈默的胸膛。“引擎熄火了。谁来驾驶我？”

She reached down and unzipped Chen Mo's pants.
她伸手拉开了陈默裤子的拉链。

"Drive me hard, Chen. Until I forget my name. Until I forget I'm a Kurosaki."

“狠狠地驾驶我，陈。直到我忘了我的名字。直到我忘了我是个黑崎。”
