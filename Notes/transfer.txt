Chapter 59: The Cold Silk

第五十九章：冷丝绸

She pushed the velvet dress off her shoulders. It fell to the floor with a heavy sigh.

她把天鹅绒裙子推下肩膀。裙子伴着一声沉重的叹息落在那地板上。

Underneath, she wore nothing but the black choker with the ruby. Her skin, still holding the warmth of the Brazilian sun, looked startling against the austere Japanese minimalism of the room.

在下面，她只戴着那条红宝石颈圈。她的皮肤还保留着巴西阳光的温度，在房间极简主义的日式冷峻中显得惊心动魄。

"Rio was hot," she murmured, stepping closer to him. "Tokyo is cold. I need heat, Chen."

“里约很热，”她喃喃着，向他靠近。“东京很冷。我需要热量，陈。”

She didn't wait for him. She unbuttoned his shirt, sliding her hands inside to feel his chest. Her fingers were cold, sending shivers down his spine.

她没等他。她解开他的衬衫，手滑进去抚摸他的胸膛。她的手指是冰凉的，让他脊背发颤。

"You bought a company today," Chen Mo's voice was rough. "Aren't you tired?"

“你今天买了一家公司，”陈默的声音沙哑。“你不累吗？”

"Power is an aphrodisiac," she bit his lower lip. "And revenge... is foreplay."

“权力是春药，”她咬住他的下唇。“而复仇……是前戏。”

She pushed him onto the low, wide bed. The sheets were crisp, high-thread-count cotton.

她把他推倒在那张低矮宽大的床上。床单是清脆的高支棉。

This wasn't the desperate, survival sex of the jungle. This was refined. Calculated. Every touch was a statement of luxury and ownership.

这不是丛林里那种绝望的、为了生存的性爱。这是精致的。经过计算的。每一次触碰都是对奢华和所有权的声明。

She straddled him, her back arched, the city lights framing her silhouette. She looked like a deity demanding worship.

她跨坐在他身上，背脊弓起，城市灯光勾勒出她的剪影。她看起来像一位索求崇拜的神祇。

"Mishima thinks he can trap me," she whispered, moving slowly against him. "But he doesn't know what I learned in the dark."

“三岛以为他能困住我，”她低语，在他身上缓慢移动。“但他不知道我在黑暗中学到了什么。”

Chen Mo reached up, his hands cupping her face. He looked into her eyes—eyes that had seen murder and madness.

陈默伸出手，捧住她的脸。他看着她的眼睛——那双见过谋杀和疯狂的眼睛。

"We will burn his web," he promised. "Strand by strand."

“我们会烧了他的网，”他承诺。“一根一根地烧。”

"Starting with Kurosaki," she leaned down, kissing him deeply. "The spider sits in the center. In the prison."

“从黑崎开始，”她俯身，深吻他。“蜘蛛坐在网中央。在监狱里。”
