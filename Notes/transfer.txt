Chapter 6: Seeking an Escape

第六章：寻求出口

The silence in the house was too loud. Miyetsuko couldn't stand the sight of her father’s slumped shoulders. She grabbed her sweater and headed for the door. "I’m going to the convenience store," she called out. She didn't wait for an answer.

家里的死寂沉重得让人喘不过气。美悦子受不了父亲那副颓然的背影。她抓起外套走向门口。“我去趟便利店，”她喊了一声，没等回应就推门而出。

She texted Shiraishi: "Meet me at the park. Now." The cool night air hit her face, but it didn't calm the turmoil in her chest. She needed to feel something other than guilt. She needed him to drown out the reality of her crumbling home.

她给白石发了条信息：“公园见，现在。” 夜凉如水，却吹不散她胸口的焦虑。她需要一些除了愧疚以外的感觉。她需要他，帮她淹没这个摇摇欲坠的家。

Shiraishi was already there, leaning against a rusted swing set. He didn't ask questions. He saw the sharp, desperate look in her eyes and pulled her into the shadows behind the slide. "Tough night?" he whispered, his hands already sliding under her sweater.

白石已经在那儿了，靠在生锈的秋千架上。他什么也没问。看到她眼里那股冷冽而绝望的劲儿，他直接把她拉到了滑梯后的阴影里。“家里不顺？”他低声问，手已经滑进了她的毛衣。

Miyetsuko didn't answer with words. She grabbed his collar and pulled him down into a frenzied kiss. She wanted to be consumed, to be used, to lose herself in the friction and the heat. Anything to stop thinking about the unpaid bills and her mother’s trembling smile.

美悦子没有回答。她死死拽住他的领口，用力吻了上去，动作有些疯狂。她想被吞噬，想被占有，想在那股摩擦和热力中迷失自我。只要能让她不再去想那些账单和母亲颤抖的微笑，什么都行。
