Chapter 16: The Ivory Arena

第十六章：象牙竞技场

Part 1: The Dressing Room Chill

更衣室的寒意

The backstage of St. Cecilia’s grand auditorium was a hive of frantic elegance. While other girls fussed over their hair, Miyetsuko sat motionless in front of her mirror. She was wearing a midnight-blue velvet gown, her skin appearing even more translucent under the harsh vanity lights.

圣塞西莉亚大礼堂的后台是一片忙碌而优雅的蜂巢。当其他女孩在为发型苦恼时，美悦子一动不动地坐在镜子前。她穿着一件午夜蓝的丝绒礼服，在刺眼的化妆灯下，她的肌肤显得愈发晶莹剔透。

Ayaka stood behind her, adjusting the sash on Miyetsuko’s waist. "You’re freezing, Miyetsuko. And you haven't said a word all morning. Is it... because of Saori?"

绫香站在她身后，调整着美悦子腰间的缎带。“你身上好冷，美悦子。你整个早上都没说一句话。是因为……沙织吗？”

Miyetsuko didn't answer. She could still smell the faint, lingering scent of various expensive colognes on Saori’s clothes when she returned that morning. It was a smell that made the music in her head feel like noise.

美悦子没有回答。她脑海里仍能闻到沙织今早回来时，衣服上残留的那种各种昂贵古龙水混合的淡味。那股味道让她脑中的音乐听起来都像噪音。

Part 2: The Rival's Sting

对手的毒刺

The door clicked open, and Eriko stepped in, her red dress a violent contrast to the room’s hushed tones. She leaned against the doorframe, a smug smile playing on her lips.

门嗒的一声开了，绘里子走了进来，她的红色礼服与房间里压抑的色调形成了强烈的反差。她靠在门框上，唇角挂着一丝得意的笑。

"Still planning to play, Queen?" Eriko purred. "I heard the pawn shops are already eyeing your Steinway. Maybe you should practice playing for tips on the street. It’s a more realistic future for a Lin, don't you think?"

“还要打算演奏吗，女王陛下？”绘里子轻声嘲讽道，“我听说当铺已经盯上你的施坦威钢琴了。也许你该练练在街头讨赏，那对林家的人来说才是更现实的未来，你不觉得吗？”

Ayaka stepped forward, her face flushed with anger. "Shut up, Eriko! You don't know anything."

绫香上前一步，气得满脸通红。“闭嘴，绘里子！你什么都不懂。”

Miyetsuko simply stood up, the platinum necklace hidden beneath her high collar pulsing with its invisible, green light. "The stage doesn't care about the bank account, Eriko. It only cares about who is superior. And that will always be me."

美悦子只是站起身，隐藏在高领下的铂金项链闪烁着隐秘的绿光。“舞台不在乎银行账户，绘里子。它只在乎谁更优越。而那个人永远会是我。”

Part 3: La Campanella

钟声

The auditorium was a sea of judgmental silence as Miyetsuko walked onto the stage. She sat at the ebony piano, the spotlight hitting her like a divine judgment. She chose Liszt’s La Campanella—a piece of terrifying technical demand.

当美悦子走上舞台时，礼堂是一片带有审判意味的死寂。她坐在乌木钢琴前，聚光灯像神圣的裁决一样打在她身上。她选择了李斯特的《钟声》——一首对技巧有着极高要求的曲目。

As her fingers began the frantic, bell-like leaps, she didn't feel the music. She felt the weight of the collective sins that kept her on this stage. Every high note was a reminder of Saori’s moans; every rapid run was the sound of her father’s desperate lies.

当她的手指开始那疯狂的、如钟鸣般的跳跃时，她感觉不到音乐。她只感到那些让她留在舞台上的集体罪恶的重量。每一个高音都在提醒她沙织的呻吟；每一个快速的跑动都是她父亲绝望谎言的回声。

The necklace felt hot against her skin. It was recording the frantic tempo of her heart, sending the data of her struggle to the man watching from the shadows of the balcony.

项链贴着她的皮肤微微发烫。它正记录着她急促的心跳节奏，将她挣扎的数据传给那个在看台阴影中注视着她的男人。

Part 4: The Phantom Voice

幻影之声

In the middle of the most difficult passage, the sound in her ears shifted. It wasn't the piano. Through the bone-conduction technology in the necklace, a voice whispered directly into her skull—low, calm, and devastating.

在最难的一段乐章中，她耳中的声音发生了变化。那不是钢琴声。通过项链中的骨传导技术，一个声音直接在她脑海中响起——低沉、冷静，且具有毁灭性。

"Play beautifully, little swan," Hasegawa Makoto’s voice murmured. "Every note you strike is paid for by a woman currently bleeding in your father’s house. Don't let her sacrifice be in vain."

“弹得美一点，小天鹅，”长谷川诚的声音呢喃着，“你弹下的每一个音符，都是由此时正在你父亲屋里流血的女人支付的。别让她的牺牲白费。”

Miyetsuko’s hand faltered for a micro-second, a missed beat that felt like a scream. She looked out into the dark audience, her eyes wide with terror. She wasn't playing for the judges anymore. She was playing for her life, trapped in a gilded cage that now had a voice.

美悦子的手迟疑了微秒，那漏掉的一拍听起来像一声尖叫。她望向黑暗的观众席，眼中写满了恐惧。她不再是为评委演奏。她在为命而战，被困在一个如今有了声音的金丝笼里。
