Chapter 70: The Throne Room

第七十章：王座厅

Kurosaki Heavy Industries. CEO's Office.

黑崎重工。CEO办公室。

The name on the door had already been changed. Miyetsuko Tanaka-Kurosaki.

门上的名字已经换了。田中-黑崎美悦子。

She walked in. The office was vast, cold, and smelled of old power.

她走了进去。办公室巨大、冰冷，闻起来有旧权力的味道。

She walked to the massive oak desk where Kurosaki used to sign death warrants. She ran her hand over the wood.

她走到那张巨大的橡木桌前，黑崎曾经在那里签署死亡令。她的手抚过木面。

She didn't sit in the chair immediately.

她没有立刻坐下。

She turned to the window. Tokyo lay beneath her feet.

她转向窗户。东京就在她脚下。

"Season 2 is over, Chen," she whispered to the reflection of the man standing by the door.

“第二季结束了，陈，”她对着门口那个男人的倒影低语。

Chen Mo locked the door. Click.

陈默锁上了门。咔哒。

"Ready for Season 3?"

“准备好第三季了吗？”

Miyetsuko sat down in the leather chair. She spun it around. She crossed her legs, the black dress riding up high. She leaned back, interlacing her fingers, looking every inch the boss.

美悦子在那张真皮椅子上坐下。转过身来。她翘起二郎腿，黑色裙摆滑得很高。她向后靠，十指交叉，看起来完全是个老板。

She picked up the phone.

她拿起电话。

"Get me Mishima," she said into the receiver. "Tell him the Queen is on the line. And she's hungry."

“给我接三岛，”她对着话筒说。“告诉他，女王在线。而且她饿了。”
