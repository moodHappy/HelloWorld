"Midnight in the Emergency Room"

Dr. Chen rubbed his eyes as the clock struck twelve. Another wild night in the ER.

"Next patient!" he sighed.

In stumbled a guy holding a pineapple. "Doc, you gotta help me! I was trying to impress this girl by juggling fruits, but then my cat attacked, and nowâ€”well, the pineapple's stuck to my head."

The nurse snorted. "That's your third ridiculous injury this month, Dave."

Dr. Chen grabbed his tools. "You know, we have a dating app recommendation list at the front desk. Might be safer than fruit juggling."

"Does it work?" Dave asked hopefully.

"Better than pineapples," the doctor deadpanned.
