My coworker spilled the tea about his relative having a second kid because their teenager is basically a "failed investment." The kid went from balanced meals to surviving on rice water and veggies. "Why waste good food on a lost cause?" they figured. They even kicked the kid out of their bedroom for the new baby's nurseryâ€”sofa life it is! The parents are treating parenting like stock trading: dump the underperforming assets and bet on the new IPO. While I can't endorse their methods, part of me wonders if they've accidentally invented the most extreme motivational technique ever. "Shape up or sleep on the couch forever!"
