Here's a 100-word short story at CEFR Level B1 in a spoken style about "日常生活类" (Daily Life):

"My typical Monday morning is always chaotic. I hit the snooze button a few times before getting out of bed. After a quick breakfast, I rush to catch the bus. On the way, I listen to music and plan my day. At work, I check emails and respond to messages. Lunch is usually with colleagues, chatting about our weekends. After work, I head to the gym to unwind. Dinner is often takeout, eaten while watching TV. It's not exciting, but it's my routine. I like the comfort of knowing what to expect."
