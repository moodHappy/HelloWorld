Lunch with Mark turned uncomfortable when I mentioned my relationship.

"Six months with Jake and I've never paid for dinner," I said.

Mark frowned. "He makes you pay for everything?"

"No, he always pays," I clarified.

His expression darkened. "A man should provide."

I laughed. "Mark, I'm the woman here."

His face immediately softened. "Oh, well that's different then. That's how it should be."

I stared at my salad, wondering why equality only mattered when it benefited men.
