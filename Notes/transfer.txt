Chapter 23: The Human Shield

第二十三章：肉盾

"Move!"

“动起来！”

Chen Mo didn't shout. He acted.

陈默没有喊。他行动了。

He tackled Miyetsuko, throwing both of them behind a stack of steel containers.

他扑倒美悦子，把两人一起甩到一堆钢制集装箱后面。

Ping! Ping! Ping!

叮！叮！叮！

High-velocity rounds sparked against the steel where she had stood a millisecond ago.

高速子弹在她毫秒前站立的地方溅起火花。

"They have thermal optics! They can see us!" Miyetsuko gasped, pressing her back against the cold metal. Her white suit was instantly stained with oil and dirt.

“他们有热成像！能看见我们！”美悦子喘息着，背紧贴着冰冷的金属。她的白西装瞬间沾满了油污。

"I know," Chen Mo pulled out a flare from a crate nearby. "So we blind them."

“我知道，”陈默从旁边的箱子里掏出一枚信号弹。“所以我们要晃瞎他们。”

He looked at her. For a second, the chaos faded. He wiped a smudge of grease from her cheek.

他看着她。有一秒钟，混乱褪去了。他擦掉她脸颊上的一抹油污。

"You command. I execute. Just like in bed," he smirked.

“你指挥。我执行。就像在床上一样，”他坏笑。

"Fuck you," she laughed breathlessly, her hand gripping his arm. "Don't die, you idiot. You still owe me an orgasm."

“去你的，”她上气不接下气地笑了，手紧紧抓着他的胳膊。“别死，蠢货。你还欠我一次高潮。”

Chen Mo ignited the flare and threw it into the open space. The blinding magnesium light washed out the attackers' night vision goggles.

陈默点燃信号弹，扔进空地。刺眼的镁光瞬间让攻击者的夜视仪过载致盲。

"Now! Run to the forklift!"

“现在！跑向叉车！”

Chen Mo jumped out, firing his Glock blindly to provide cover. He wasn't hiding behind her. He was standing tall, drawing fire, making himself the target so his Queen could move.

陈默跳了出去，盲射格洛克提供掩护。他没有躲在她身后。他挺身而出，吸引火力，让自己成为靶子，好让他的女王能移动。

Miyetsuko sprinted. She didn't look back. She trusted him with her life.

美悦子狂奔。她没回头。她把命交给了他。

She jumped into the heavy-duty forklift.

她跳进重型叉车。

"Eat this, you bastards!"

“吃这个吧，混蛋们！”

She slammed the levers. The forklift roared, lifting a massive container full of frozen tuna.

她猛推操纵杆。叉车咆哮，举起一个装满冷冻金枪鱼的巨大集装箱。

With a feral scream, she drove the forklift forward, ramming the container into the group of blinded mercenaries.

伴随着一声野性的尖叫，她开着叉车向前冲，把集装箱狠狠撞向那群致盲的雇佣兵。

CRUNCH.

咔嚓。

The sound of bones breaking under tons of steel was sickeningly satisfying.

骨头在数吨钢铁下碎裂的声音令人作呕地满足。
