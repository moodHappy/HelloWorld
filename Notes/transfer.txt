Chapter 54: The Mile-High Armor

第五十四章：万米高空的铠甲

Gulfstream G650. Cruising altitude: 40,000 feet.

湾流G650私人飞机。巡航高度：四万英尺。

The cabin was quiet, smelling of leather and vintage champagne. Outside the window, the Pacific Ocean was a sheet of black ice.

机舱里很安静，弥漫着皮革和陈年香槟的味道。窗外，太平洋是一片黑色的冰原。

Miyetsuko stood in the center of the cabin. The Rio tan was still on her skin, glowing against the dim mood lighting. She was naked, except for a pair of sheer black stockings.

美悦子站在机舱中央。里约的晒痕还留在她皮肤上，在昏暗的情调灯光下发光。她赤裸着，除了腿上那双透明的黑色长筒丝袜。

"Rio was fire," she whispered, looking at her reflection in the darkened window. "Tokyo is ice. I need to dress for the cold."

“里约是火，”她低声对着窗户里的倒影说。“东京是冰。我得穿得御寒点。”

Chen Mo sat on the leather sofa, watching her. He held a black velvet dress. It was Saint Laurent. Sharp, structural, backless. A dress for a funeral, or an execution.

陈默坐在皮沙发上，看着她。他手里拿着一条黑色天鹅绒裙子。圣罗兰的高定。剪裁锋利，大露背。这是一条适合葬礼，或者行刑的裙子。

"Come here," he commanded softly.

“过来，”他轻声命令。

She walked to him. The motion of the plane made her sway slightly. She stepped into the dress.

她走向他。飞机的晃动让她微微摇摆。她跨进了裙子。

Chen Mo pulled the fabric up. It slid over her hips, hugging her curves like a lover's hand. He stood up to zip the back.

陈默把布料拉上来。它滑过她的臀部，像情人的手一样紧贴着她的曲线。他站起来去拉背后的拉链。

Zzzzip.

滋——

The sound was slow. Deliberate.

声音缓慢。刻意。

His fingers didn't leave her back. He traced her spine, stopping at the nape of her neck.

他的手指没有离开她的背。他沿着脊椎划过，停在她的后颈。

"You are tense," he murmured, feeling the muscles knot under the velvet.

“你很紧张，”他低语，感觉到天鹅绒下紧绷的肌肉。

"I'm going back to the cage," she leaned back against him. "Even if I hold the key... it's still the cage."

“我要回到笼子里了，”她向后靠在他身上。“即使我拿着钥匙……那依然是笼子。”

"No," Chen Mo turned her around. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a necklace. A simple, black choker with a single, blood-red ruby. "You are the zookeeper now."

“不，”陈默把她转过来。他伸手进口袋，拿出一条项链。一条简单的黑色颈圈，坠着一颗血红的红宝石。“你现在是饲养员。”

He fastened the necklace. The cold gem settled in the hollow of her throat.

他扣好项链。冰冷的宝石落在她的喉咙窝里。

"Look at me," he lifted her chin. "In Rio, you were a soldier. In Tokyo, you are a myth. Myths don't get scared."

“看着我，”他抬起她的下巴。“在里约，你是士兵。在东京，你是神话。神话是不会害怕的。”

Miyetsuko looked into his eyes. The fear faded, replaced by a cold, sharp resolve.

美悦子看着他的眼睛。恐惧褪去，取而代之的是冷酷、锋利的决心。

"Kiss me, Chen. Before we land. I need your taste to wash away the fear."

“吻我，陈。在降落之前。我需要你的味道来冲刷恐惧。”

He kissed her. It wasn't rough. It was deep, possessive, and lingering. A kiss that sealed a pact.

他吻了她。不粗暴。深沉、占有欲极强、绵长。一个封印契约的吻。
