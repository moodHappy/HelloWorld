Chapter 66: The Sea of Umbrellas

第六十六章：伞的海洋

Aoyama Cemetery. Tokyo.

东京青山灵园。

The rain fell in sheets, turning the grey gravestones into slick, dark mirrors. A sea of black umbrellas bobbed in the mist. The elite of Japan—politicians, CEOs, Yakuza oyabuns—had gathered to bury Kurosaki Soichiro.

大雨倾盆，把灰色的墓碑变成了光滑、黑暗的镜子。一片黑伞的海洋在雾气中浮动。日本的精英——政客、CEO、极道组长——聚集在一起埋葬黑崎宗一郎。

Miyetsuko stood at the front.

美悦子站在最前面。

She wore a bespoke Givenchy mourning dress. It was black, modest, yet cut so precisely that it made every other woman look like they were wearing a sack. A veil of black lace covered her face, hiding her eyes.

她穿着一件纪梵希定制的丧服。全黑，端庄，但剪裁精准得让其他女人看起来像是穿着麻袋。一层黑色蕾丝面纱遮住了她的脸，藏起了她的眼睛。

People whispered. "The poor widow." "She looks devastated."

人们在低语。“可怜的寡妇。”“她看起来崩溃了。”

Under the veil, Miyetsuko was smiling.

在面纱下，美悦子在笑。

Chen Mo stood beside her, holding a large black umbrella over her head. He was dry. She was dry. The rest of the world was drowning.

陈默站在她身边，为她撑着一把巨大的黑伞。他是干的。她是干的。剩下的世界都在溺水。
