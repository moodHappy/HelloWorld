The Time Door

The blue door appeared in Emma's bedroom at midnight. It hadn't been there before. Hesitantly, she turned the knob and stepped through.

She found herself in a meadow filled with unfamiliar flowers. A woman who looked like her grandmother—but younger—was picking daisies. When the woman turned, Emma gasped. It was her grandmother, holding her mother as a baby.

Emma stepped back as the door began to fade. She now understood the family secret: they were all time travelers, and the door was their inheritance.
