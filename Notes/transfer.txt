The Funeral

葬礼

She lay in a simple coffin, the room smelling faintly of lilies and wax.

她躺在一个简单的棺材里，房间里弥漫着淡淡的百合花和蜡的气味。

The church was nearly empty, just a handful of colleagues and distant friends.

教堂几乎空无一人，只有几个同事和不太熟的朋友。

No one spoke her name aloud; it hovered silently in the air.

没有人出声叫她的名字；它静静地悬在空气里。

A priest read from a book, his voice steady but hollow.

神父从书中朗读，他的声音平稳却空洞。

She had planned her own service with quiet precision, leaving instructions on what to play and what to say.

她早已悄悄规划好了自己的葬礼，留下了播放什么、说什么的指示。

Her hair, once a defiant statement, was gone, replaced by the smooth curve of her scalp.

她的头发，曾经的倔强宣言，如今已经不在，只剩光滑的头皮曲线。

Friends draped scarves over their shoulders, trying to honor her memory without invading it.

朋友们把围巾披在肩上，试图纪念她，却不去打扰她。

Someone whispered a story about her last days, careful, almost reverent.

有人低声讲起她最后的日子，小心翼翼，几乎带着敬意。

The casket closed with a soft thud, final and absolute.

棺材轻轻合上，声音柔和，却带着最终的绝对感。

Outside, the sky was gray, the wind carrying a chill that seemed to mirror the room inside.

外面，天空灰沉，风带着寒意，仿佛映照着屋内的氛围。

The earth swallowed her quietly, methodically, without ceremony beyond necessity.

大地默默、谨慎地吞没了她，没有超出必要的仪式。

No flowers could reclaim what had been lost.

没有花能够挽回已经失去的东西。

And yet, in the stillness, there was a strange kind of order, a closure she had always craved.

然而，在寂静中，有一种奇怪的秩序感，这是她一直渴望的结局。

Her absence was absolute, but so was the control she had held until the very end.

她的离去是彻底的，但她在最后依然掌握着一切。
