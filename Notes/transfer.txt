I'd spent 15 months undercover with the Sharks gang, carefully building trust. One day, they strung me up by my feet. "How'd you figure me out?" I asked, genuinely confused. The boss laughed, "Remember when I sent you to pay our 'social security'? The clerk called to confirm, said they'd never had an actual gang member file paperwork so meticulously!" I groaned. My old police habits had betrayed me - I'd included receipts, itemized deductions, and even got the gang registered as a small business for tax benefits. "We're criminals," the boss sighed, "not accountants."
