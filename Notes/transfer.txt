Chapter 12: The Unexpected Encounter

第十二章：意外的相遇

The storage room was a mess of shadows and heavy breathing, but once the recording stopped, the reality of the weekend took over. They walked through the mall, the bright fluorescent lights a sharp contrast to the dim school attic. Miyetsuko adjusted her collar, still feeling the ghost of his touch on her skin. She felt exposed, as if everyone knew what they had just done.

储藏室里曾满是阴影和粗重的呼吸，但录像一停，周末的现实感便扑面而来。他们走在商场里，明亮的荧光灯与昏暗的学校阁楼形成鲜明对比。美悦子理了理领口，皮肤上似乎还残存着他触碰过的余温。她总觉得有些心虚，仿佛每个人都知道他们刚才干了什么。

"Look, the new sneakers are out," Shiraishi said, nodding toward a shop window. Before Miyetsuko could reply, a sharp, familiar voice cut through the crowd. "Well, well. If it isn't my little sister and her 'study buddy'." Standing there, a shopping bag swinging from her arm, was Mizuki Min. Her older sister had a smirk that suggested she knew exactly why Miyetsuko’s hair was slightly messy.

“瞧，新款运动鞋上市了，”白石指着橱窗说道。还没等美悦子搭话，一个尖锐且熟悉的嗓音穿过人群传了过来。“哟，这不是我那宝贝妹妹和她的‘学习搭子’吗？”站在那里的正是美月眠，她手里晃着购物袋，嘴角带着一抹坏笑，仿佛一眼就看穿了美悦子头发为什么有点乱。

Mizuki stepped closer, her eyes scanning Miyetsuko from head to toe. She leaned in, her perfume clashing with the faint, musky scent still clinging to Miyetsuko’s uniform. "You look a little flushed, Miyetsu," she whispered, her voice dripping with mischief. "The 'library' must have been really hot today." Miyetsuko stiffened, her heart skipping a beat. Her sister was a natural provocateur, always looking for a way to stir up trouble.

美月眠走近了几步，眼神从头到脚打量着美悦子。她凑了上来，身上的香水味与美悦子校服上残留的那股淡淡腥甜气味冲撞在一起。“你脸红得厉害啊，美悦子，”她低声说道，语气里全是恶作剧的味道，“‘图书馆’今天一定很热吧。”美悦子身体一僵，心跳漏了一拍。她姐姐是个天生的拱火高手，总在找机会制造麻烦。

Shiraishi tried to act natural, but he subconsciously shifted his weight, shielding Miyetsuko slightly. Mizuki noticed the movement and giggled, a sound that made Miyetsuko’s skin crawl. "Don't be so tense, Shiraishi-kun. I'm not going to tell Mom... yet. But you owe me. Big time." She winked, her eyes darting to the phone in Shiraishi’s pocket, almost as if she knew about the secret digital trophy hidden inside.

白石试着表现自然点，却下意识地挪了下步子，挡在美悦子身前。美月眠注意到这个动作，咯咯笑了起来，笑声听得美悦子心里发毛。“别那么紧张，白石君。我不会告诉妈的……暂时不会。但你欠我个人情，大人情。”她眨了眨眼，目光扫向白石兜里的手机，就好像她知道里面藏着那个秘密的电子战利品一样。
