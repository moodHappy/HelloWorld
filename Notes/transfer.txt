"Hey kid, it's me. You from the future. Don't grow up. It's not worth it." I wrapped my hands around the tiny throat, squeezing as tears streamed down my face. The nurses screamed as they tackled me, but I was already fading. "I'm saving us," I whispered to the infant, watching its face turn blue. "From all the pain, the disappointment, the heartbreak." My body became translucent as they pinned me to the cold hospital floor. "Better to end it now," I muttered, disappearing completely. "Trust me." And then, nothing. Just the echo of a life that would never be.
