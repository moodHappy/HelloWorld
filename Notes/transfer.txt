好的，我给这个故事加一个小反转结尾，英文版：

Ethan walked into the store and immediately spotted the T-shirt he had secretly been eyeing for weeks—it had the logo of his favorite band. He picked it up excitedly, already imagining himself wearing it at the concert.

“How much is this T-shirt?” he asked.

The clerk looked down and said awkwardly, “Sorry, this T-shirt has been discontinued.”

Ethan froze, staring at the empty rack. His heart sank a little—it seemed that if you hesitated too long, someone else would always get there first.

He sighed and started to turn away—but then, from behind the counter, the clerk whispered, “Wait… we actually have one more in the back. Nobody asked for it yet.”

Ethan’s eyes lit up. “Really?”

The clerk nodded and handed it to him. Ethan grinned, holding the T-shirt like a trophy: sometimes, patience—and a little luck—pays off after all.
