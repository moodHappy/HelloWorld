# Unexpected Coincidence

Emma bought a secondhand book in London, finding a faded photograph inside—a young woman standing before the Eiffel Tower. Intrigued, she posted it online. A week later, she received an email: the woman in the photo was her grandmother, taken before Emma's mother was born. The book had belonged to Emma's grandfather, who had lost it decades ago. Through this chain of events, Emma discovered a branch of her family she never knew existed. The universe, it seemed, had orchestrated a perfect reunion through a simple book purchase.
