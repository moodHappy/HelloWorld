Chapter 54: The Most Wanted Lovers

第五十四章：头号通缉情侣

"Transaction complete. 500 million yen, routed to a Swiss numbered account." Kenji handed them two black credit cards and new passports. "The IDs are clean. 'Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka', art dealers from Kyoto."

“交易完成。5亿日元，汇入了瑞士的匿名账户。”健二递给他们两张黑色信用卡和新护照。“证件是干净的。‘田中夫妇’，来自京都的艺术品商人。”

Miyetsuko snatched the cards. Her fingers were stained with grease, creating a stark contrast with the platinum chips on the cards.

美悦子一把抓过卡片。她的手指沾满油污，与卡片上的白金芯片形成了鲜明的对比。

"Get us out of here," she hissed. "I can feel this canvas sanding my nipples off."

“带我们离开这儿，”她嘶嘶地说。“我感觉这帆布要把我的乳头磨掉了。”

They walked out of the cyber-slum into the blinding noon sun.

他们走出网络贫民窟，走进刺眼的午后阳光里。

Passing an electronics store, a wall of 8K TVs was broadcasting the same breaking news.

路过一家电器店时，一整面墙的8K电视正在播放同一条突发新闻。

"BREAKING: Massive Explosion at Yokohama Port. Suspects Identified as 'The Bonnie and Clyde of Tokyo'."

“突发新闻：横滨港发生大规模爆炸。嫌疑人被确认为‘东京的邦妮和克莱德’。”

On the screen, a grainy security footage from the warehouse showed two figures running. One was a man in a suit, the other a woman in... a black leather racing suit, her chest exposed, firing a gun.

屏幕上，一段来自仓库的模糊监控录像显示两个人影在奔跑。一个穿着西装的男人，另一个是穿着……黑色皮赛车服、胸口敞开、正在开枪的女人。

"Look at that," Miyetsuko stopped, ignoring the passersby staring at her dirty jumpsuit. She pointed at the screen, a twisted smile appearing on her smudge-covered face. "They didn't censor my cleavage. The ratings must be through the roof."

“看那个，”美悦子停下脚步，无视路人对她脏兮兮连体服的注视。她指着屏幕，满是污迹的脸上浮现出一抹扭曲的笑。“他们没给我的乳沟打码。收视率肯定爆表了。”

"We are famous," Chen Mo pulled her hat lower. "And dangerous. Let's go before someone recognizes your... assets."

“我们出名了，”陈默把她的帽子拉低。“也很危险。在有人认出你的……‘资产’之前，快走。”
