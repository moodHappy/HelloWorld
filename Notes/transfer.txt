Chapter 2: The Ice Cube Game

第二章：冰块游戏

Chen Mo sat on the edge of her lounge chair. He picked up an ice cube from his drink.

陈默坐在她躺椅的边缘。他从酒杯里夹起一块冰块。

"You wanted peace. We have peace," he traced the ice cube down her sternum.

“你想要平静。我们现在很平静，”他拿着冰块沿着她的胸骨向下滑动。

Miyetsuko hissed as the cold touched her hot skin. Her nipples hardened instantly under the thin gold fabric, pushing against the material like bullets.

当寒冷触碰到滚烫的皮肤时，美悦子发出一声嘶嘶声。她的乳头在薄薄的金色布料下瞬间变硬，像子弹一样顶着布料。

"Peace is for dead people," she arched her back, chasing the cold sensation. "I miss the rain in Tokyo. I miss the fear. I miss... the hunt."

“平静是给死人享受的，”她弓起背，追逐着那股冰凉的感觉。“我想念东京的雨。我想念恐惧。我想念……狩猎。”

She grabbed Chen Mo's wrist and guided the ice cube lower, past her navel, towards the dangerous heat between her thighs.

她抓住陈默的手腕，引导冰块向下滑，滑过肚脐，滑向她大腿之间那危险的热度。

"The local drug lord, 'El Fantasma', invited us to his carnival party tonight," Chen Mo said, watching the ice melt into water on her skin. "He wants to launder money through our 'art dealership'."

“当地毒枭‘幽灵’邀请我们参加今晚的狂欢节派对，”陈默看着冰块在她皮肤上融化成水。“他想通过我们的‘艺术品生意’洗钱。”

Miyetsuko's eyes lit up. The predator woke up.

美悦子的眼睛亮了。掠食者醒了。

"A drug lord? Is he dangerous?"

“毒枭？他危险吗？”

"He feeds people to his pet jaguars if they bore him."

“如果有人让他感到无聊，他会把那个人喂给他养的美洲豹。”

"Perfect," she smiled, biting her lip. "What should I wear? Something that says 'I can handle your jaguars'?"

“完美，”她咬着嘴唇笑了。“我该穿什么？那种能表达‘我也能搞定你的美洲豹’的衣服？”

"Something that hides a knife," Chen Mo let the ice cube drop onto her bikini bottom. The cold water soaked the fabric instantly, turning it transparent.

“能藏住刀的衣服，”陈默松手，让冰块掉在她的比基尼下装上。冰水瞬间浸透了布料，让它变得透明。

"Ah!" she gasped, her legs clamping together. "You bad boy..."

“啊！”她倒吸一口气，双腿夹紧。“你这个坏男孩……”
