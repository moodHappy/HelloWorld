Chapter 5: Suffocating Gentleness

第五章：窒息般的温柔

Before Chen Mo could set down his cup, warmth and softness surrounded him.

陈默甚至来不及放下酒杯，就被柔软而温热的触感包围。

It was completely different from the thin restraint he knew in the city.

那触感与城市里熟悉的克制与骨感完全不同。

When she moved close, he felt as if he had fallen into something soft yet full of heat.

她主动贴近时，他像陷进一团柔软却炽热的怀抱。

“Don’t speak,” she whispered, touching his lips before kissing him with the taste of plum wine.

“别说话……”她按住他的唇，随后带着梅酒气息吻了下来。

The kiss carried calm control and quiet guidance.

这个吻带着成熟的从容，也带着清晰的引导。

His restraint broke, and the pressure of the past years rushed out at once.

他的理智在这一刻断开，积压多年的疲惫一起涌出。

He held her clumsily, feeling warmth and fullness beneath his hands.

他笨拙地回抱，只感到掌心里的温度与柔软。

When they fell onto the tatami, her presence filled his sight and breath.

当两人倒在榻榻米上，她的存在几乎占满他的视线与呼吸。

She leaned over him, hair falling across his chest, her voice low beside his ear.

她俯身靠近，长发垂落在他胸前，声音贴在他耳边。

“Do you like it?” she asked softly. “You are the first to hold me like this.”

“喜欢吗？”她轻声问，“你是第一个这样抱我的人。”

In that moment she was no longer bound by daily life, only alive in the night and rain.

那一刻的她不再被日常束缚，只在雨夜中真实存在。

Chen Mo felt himself drifting without direction, yet he did not resist.

陈默像失去方向般下沉，却没有抗拒。
