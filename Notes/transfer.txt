Maya could see others' memories. When she touched someone, fragments of their past would flood her mind—first kisses, painful losses, childhood joys. It was both a gift and a burden. One day, she accidentally brushed against an elderly man at the park. Suddenly, she witnessed his wartime experiences, his marriage, the birth of his children. Tears filled her eyes. "Are you okay?" he asked kindly. Maya nodded, overwhelmed by the intimacy of sharing a stranger's life story in an instant. She smiled, realizing her ability wasn't just about seeing memories—it was about understanding the invisible threads connecting all human hearts.
