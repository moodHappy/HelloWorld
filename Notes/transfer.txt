The Paranoiac

偏执狂

He checked the lock three times before leaving.
Once with his eyes, once with his hand, once with his memory.

他出门前检查了三次门锁。
一次用眼睛，一次用手，一次用记忆。

The corridor smelled of damp paint and old shoes.
A light flickered at the far end, steady enough to be suspicious.

走廊里有潮湿油漆和旧鞋子的味道。
尽头的灯一闪一闪，稳定得令人不安。

At the bus stop, he stood apart from the others.
A woman coughed. A man checked his phone.
Both actions felt directed.

在公交站，他站在其他人之外。
一个女人咳嗽，一个男人看手机。
这两个动作都像是冲着他来的。

He counted the seconds between arrivals.
Too regular. Someone had planned it.

他计算车辆到站的时间间隔。
太规律了，一定有人安排过。

On the bus, he chose the seat behind the driver.
Mirrors showed everything. Mirrors never lied.

上车后，他坐在司机后方。
后视镜能看到一切。镜子不会说谎。

A boy laughed two rows back.
The laugh ended too fast.

后面两排有个男孩笑了一声。
笑声结束得太快。

He imagined notes being taken.
Time. Direction. His breathing.

他想象有人在记录。
时间，方向，他的呼吸。

At work, his desk had been moved a few centimeters.
No one admitted it. That confirmed everything.

到了单位，他的桌子被挪动了几厘米。
没人承认，这反而证实了一切。

He skipped lunch.
Food was an easy entry point.

他没去吃午饭。
食物是最容易下手的地方。

In the afternoon, an email arrived with no subject.
Just a blank body and a timestamp.

下午，一封没有标题的邮件发来。
正文是空的，只留下时间。

He smiled for the first time that day.
They were getting careless.

这是他今天第一次笑。
对方开始大意了。

At night, he returned home and checked the lock again.
Three times were not enough.

夜里回到家，他又检查了门锁。
三次已经不够。

He stayed awake, listening to the building breathe.
Pipes, steps, the elevator cable pulling upward.

他醒着，听整栋楼的呼吸。
水管，脚步，电梯钢索上拉的声音。

No one came.
That was the real message.

没有人来。
这才是真正的信号。
