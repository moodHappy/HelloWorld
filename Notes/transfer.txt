# Reversed Ending

The detective cornered the suspect in the abandoned warehouse. "It's over, Collins," he said. "The evidence against you is undeniable."

Collins merely smiled. "You've been chasing the wrong man this whole time."

Before the detective could react, he heard a click behind him. His partner, Miller, had his weapon trained on him.

"How could you?" the detective asked, devastated.

Miller smiled coldly. "Because you never would have suspected me. Your trust was your weakness, just as planned."
