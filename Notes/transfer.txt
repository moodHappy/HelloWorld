A Normal Morning

Tom woke up ten minutes late.

He jumped out of bed, brushed his teeth in a hurry, and grabbed the first shirt he could find.
 It had a small coffee stain, but he decided no one would notice.

In the kitchen, his phone buzzed.

A message from his mom: “Did you eat breakfast?”

He smiled and typed, “Of course.
”
Then he took a banana from the counter and ran out the door.

The bus was crowded, as usual.
 A woman stepped on his foot and apologized.
 Tom said, “It’s okay,” even though it hurt a little.

At work, his computer took forever to start.
 He stared at the screen, thinking about coffee.
 When it finally turned on, he realized he had forgotten his charger.

At lunchtime, a coworker shared half of her sandwich with him.

“Rough morning?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Tom said, laughing.
 “But it’s getting better.
”

That evening, Tom went home tired but calm.
 He ate instant noodles, watched a silly show, and answered his mom’s message again.

“Yes,” he typed.
 “I ate.
”

It wasn’t a special day.

But it was a good one.
