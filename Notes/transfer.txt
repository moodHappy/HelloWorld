Chapter 5: The Audit of Flesh

第五章：肉体审计

Part 1: The Tax Man’s Due

税务官的应得

The Lin family study smelled of panic and burnt coffee. On the mahogany desk, littered with foreclosure notices, Auditor Tanaka was collecting his immediate tax.

林家书房里弥漫着恐慌和烧焦咖啡的味道。在那张堆满止赎通知的红木办公桌上，审计员田中正在收取他即时的“税款”。

Saori was bent over the desk, her skirt hiked up to her waist. Tanaka, a man usually buried in spreadsheets, was buried in her from behind. His thrusts were not romantic; they were punitive, like stamping a "REJECTED" seal onto a failed document.

沙织俯身趴在桌上，裙子被撩到腰间。田中这个平日里埋首于电子表格的男人，此刻正从后面深深埋入她的体内。他的抽插毫无浪漫可言，带着惩罚性，就像在给一份失败的文件盖上“驳回”的印章。

He gripped her hips tightly, his breath hot and sour against her neck. Saori let out short, sharp gasps as he hit her deepest point again and again. Her fingers gripped the edge of the desk, knuckles white, as ripples of intense, involuntary pleasure washed through her submissive body. She didn't want it, but she couldn't stop feeling it.

他紧紧抓住她的臀部，呼吸灼热而酸臭地喷在她脖子上。随着他一次次撞击她的最深处，沙织发出短促、尖锐的喘息。她的手指紧扣着桌沿，指节发白，强烈而身不由己的快感像波纹般扫过她顺从的身体。她并不想要，但她无法停止感觉。

Part 2: The Liquidation Secret

清算秘密

"You like that, don't you? You little corporate whore," Tanaka grunted, slapping her ass loudly. The sound echoed in the tense room.

“你喜欢这样，对吧？你这个公司荡妇，”田中低吼着，重重地拍打她的屁股。清脆的声响在紧绷的房间里回荡。

Saori cried out, a broken, high-pitched moan that was half-sob, half-ecstasy. Her mind was empty, just a receiver for his aggression.

沙织叫了出来，那是一声破碎、尖锐的呻吟，半是啜泣，半是狂喜。她的大脑一片空白，只是一个承受他侵略的接收器。

As Tanaka reached his climax, he leaned his full weight onto her back, shuddering violently. He grabbed her hair, pulling her head back so she had to look at the ceiling.

当田中达到高潮时，他把全身重量都压在她背上，剧烈地颤抖着。他抓住她的头发，把她的头向后拉，迫使她仰望天花板。

"They think Kurosaki will save them," he panted right into her ear, his semen flooding her inside. "But Kurosaki isn't buying the company. He’s buying the debt. He’s going to strip this place bare by Friday. The girl is just a bonus."

“他们以为黑崎会救他们，”他就在她耳边喘息着，精液在她体内泛滥。“但黑崎不是要买公司。他是要买下债务。周五之前他就会把这里拆得精光。那个女孩只是个赠品。”

Part 3: The Panic Room

恐慌室

Downstairs, the main hall was a shipwreck. Phones were ringing off the hook, unattended. The few remaining staff members were looting the silver pantry, shoving forks and plates into bags before fleeing into the night.

楼下，主厅就像一艘沉船。电话铃声此起彼伏，无人接听。仅存的几名工作人员正在洗劫银器储藏室，把叉子和盘子塞进包里，然后逃入夜色。

Mr. Lin stood in the center of the chaos, his tie loosened, his face a mask of red fury. He was screaming at a lawyer on his mobile phone, demanding impossibilities.

林先生站在混乱的中心，领带松垮，脸红得像戴着愤怒面具。他对着手机那头的律师咆哮，要求着不可能实现的事。

"Where is she?! Where is Miyetsuko?" he suddenly yelled, realizing the silence amidst the noise. "Get her down here! She needs to sign the papers!"

“她在哪儿？！美悦子在哪儿？”他突然大喊，在噪音中意识到了那片死寂。“把她带下来！她得签字！”

Part 4: The Empty Cage

空笼子

A terrified maid ran down the grand staircase, clutching a wet, discarded white gala dress she found near the front doors.

一个惊恐的女佣抓着一件在正门附近发现的、湿漉漉被丢弃的白色盛装礼服，跑下了大楼梯。

"Master Lin... she's gone. The doors were open. She ran into the storm."

“林老爷……她不见了。大门开着。她跑进了暴风雨里。”

The sound Mr. Lin made was not human. It was the sound of a man realizing his last chip had just rolled off the table. The fortress had fallen, and the prize bird had flown straight into the jaws of the night.

林先生发出的声音不像是人类能发出的。那是一个意识到自己最后一枚筹码滚落赌桌的男人的声音。堡垒已陷落，而那只珍贵的鸟儿已径直飞入了黑夜的口中。
