The Evergreen Library stood untouched by time. When Sarah stepped inside, the grandfather clock stilled its pendulum. Dust drifted but never fell, suspended in golden shafts of light. Readers sat with books frozen mid-turn, their expressions poised between curiosity and wonder.

<i>常青图书馆未被时间触碰。当萨拉踏入其中，古老的落地钟停止了钟摆的摇动。尘埃漂浮却从不落下，悬停在金色的光柱中。读者们手中的书停在半翻的瞬间，表情在好奇与惊叹之间凝固。</i>

She soon realized she alone could move in this sanctuary of halted hours. Through aisles of boundless knowledge she wandered, each volume murmuring its secrets as she passed, their voices carrying the weight of centuries.

<i>她很快意识到，唯有她能够在这个停滞的时光圣地中移动。她漫步在无尽知识的书道间，每一本书在她经过时低声诉说着自己的秘密，它们的声音承载着数世纪的重量。</i>

Here, time was not lost but held in trust—a library where every moment lingered, and each reader could remain forever between the turning of one page and the next.

<i>在这里，时间不是消逝，而是被信任地保存——一座每个瞬间都得以停留的图书馆，每位读者都能永远驻留在翻页的一瞬之间。</i>
