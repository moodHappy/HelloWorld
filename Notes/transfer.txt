The Email That Stayed Unsent

The email arrived at 3:12 a.m., when the apartment was quiet enough to hear the refrigerator click.

邮件是在凌晨三点十二分到的，屋里静得能听见冰箱轻轻的咔哒声。

Lena was awake, sitting at the small table by the window, a cup of cold tea beside her.

莉娜醒着，坐在窗边的小桌前，手边是一杯已经凉了的茶。

Her phone lit up once, then went dark.

手机亮了一下，又暗了下去。

She did not open it right away.

她没有立刻点开。

Subject Line

The subject line said only: “Are you still there?”

主题只有一句：“你还在吗？”

No punctuation, no name.

没有标点，也没有署名。

She read it twice, then a third time, as if it might change.

她看了两遍，又看了第三遍，仿佛字会自己变。

The Sender

The address was familiar in an old way.

发件地址很熟悉，是那种旧得发灰的熟悉。

A workplace domain she hadn’t seen in years.

一个她好多年没见过的工作邮箱后缀。

She pictured him automatically: thin jacket, always underdressed, coffee on his breath.

她几乎是本能地想起了他：单薄的外套，总是穿少一层，呼吸里有咖啡味。

They had not spoken since the day she packed a box and left it by the door.

他们自从那天她把箱子放在门口后，就再也没说过话。

The Body Text

She opened the email.

她点开了邮件。

It was short.

内容很短。

“I found your old address while clearing files.”

“我在清理文件时看到了你以前的地址。”

“I wasn’t sure if it still worked.”

“也不确定还能不能用。”

“I don’t need anything.”

“我没有别的事。”

She stopped there.

她看到这里就停住了。

The Apartment

The radiator hissed, uneven and tired.

暖气片嘶嘶作响，声音不稳，像是累了。

Outside, a tram passed, metal scraping metal.

窗外有电车经过，金属摩擦金属。

She noticed the dust on the table, the ring left by the cup.

她注意到桌上的灰，还有杯子留下的水痕。

All things that would still be there if she never replied.

如果她永远不回，这些东西也都会在。

The Reply Draft

She tapped “Reply.”

她点了“回复”。

The cursor blinked.

光标一闪一闪。

She typed one sentence.

她敲了一句话。

“I’m here.”

“我在。”

She read it, then deleted it.

她看了一眼，又删掉了。

Typed another.

又打了一句。

“What do you want?”

“你想要什么？”

Deleted again.

又删了。

Her fingers hovered, slightly stiff.

她的手指悬在屏幕上，有点僵。

The Decision

She closed the draft without saving.

她关掉了草稿，没有保存。

Set the phone face down.

把手机扣在桌上。

The email stayed unread on his side.

那封邮件，在他那一头，仍然是未读。

She drank the rest of the cold tea.

她把那杯凉茶喝完了。

It tasted thin, but real.

味道很淡，但是真的。
