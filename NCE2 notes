【Text】
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up
very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the
telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'
'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.
'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'

很晚. 我望望窗外, 外面一片昏暗. “鬼天气!” 我想, “又下雨了. “正在这时, 电话铃响了. 是我姑母露西打来
的. “我刚下火车, “她说, “我这就来看你. “
“但我还在吃早饭, “我说.
“你在干什么?” 她问道.
“我正在吃早饭, “我又说了一遍.
“天啊, “她说, “你总是起得这么晚吗?现在已经 1 点钟了!”

Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens.

understand a word. Everyday I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to
my friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole
day in my room, but I did not write a single card!

参考译文：

务员教了我几句意大利语, 之后还借给我一本书. 我读了几行, 但一个字也不懂. 我每天都想着明信片的事.
假期过得真快, 可我还没有给我的朋友们寄过一张明信片. 到了最后一天, 我作出了一项重大决定. 我早早
起了床, 买来了 37 张明信片. 我在房间里关了整整一天. 然而竟连一张明信片也没写成!

或者不加任何时间状语。
一般过去时与现在完成时的共同点：动作在过去都做过了；区别：过去式只能强调过去的事, 和现在
没有任何关系.

但另外还有一些系动词同时又是不及物的实义动词, 常见的有 : seem, look, appear, sound, taste, feel,
smell, stay, remain, keep, grow, turn, go, run, get, prove, stand 等, 这些词有的语法书上称为半联系动词.

在语法上, 冠词（an/a）、形容词性物主代词（his/my/your）、名词所有格（my mother's）不能同时并存
的, 一般要用只能用其中一个
another=an +other 另外一个，强调的是剩下的还有好几个当中的一个, 强调的是有三个以上
other 其它的, 加单数就表示一个, his 取代 the 的位置
语法的范围正在放宽松, his another 也对, 但不太好
else 其他的，放在被修饰词的后面, 会修饰两种词, 疑问词和不定代词
修饰疑问代词： who else,...
What else can I do for you?
修饰不定代词：anyone else, anything else

【Key structures】
**过去进行时**
过去进行时的构成：be 的过去式+现在分词
过去进行时和一般过去时经常同在一个句子里使用。过去进行时表示过去正在进行的动作或情况，一
般过去时则表示比较短暂的动作或事件。正在进行中的动作或情况往往由连词 when，while，as，just as
等引导。
when，while 当......时候（强调动作同时发生）
while+从句, 动词一定是延续性动词


when+延续性动词/瞬间动词
while 能用 when 代替，但是 when 却不一定能用 while 代替。while 通常只引导持续时间较长的动作，
并且主句和从句可以同时用过去进行时，而 when 和as 一般不这么用。
John was watching TV while his wife was talking with a neighbour over the phone.
Just as I was leaving the house, you came in.
when 也可以引导比较短暂的动作，while 和 as 则一般不行。
We were having supper when the lights went out.
过去进行时往往与表示一段时间的状语连用，如 all morning，all night，all day，all evening，the whole
week 等，表示这段时间一直在干什么。
What were you doing all evening? I couldn’t find you anywhere.

过去动作同时发生的时态
① 过去两个动作同时发生, 习惯上一个用一般过去时, 另一个用过去进行时；动作长用过去进行时,
动作短用一般过去时; 分工的情况, 动作的开始时间和结束时间几乎相同, 均用过去进行时;
I was listening to the radio, my sister was dancing.
When my mother was doing the housework, my father was watching TV.
② 两个动作在同时段进行, 在不同时间结束, 先发生的动作未结束, 另一个动作发生, 先发生的动作用
进行时态, 另一个动作用过去时.
When I was opening the door, the telephone rang. 先 开 门
When the telephone was ringing, I opened the door. 电话先响
③ 瞬间动词（如：arrive）没有进行时态, 所以两个动作同时发生, 延续性动词用进行时态, 瞬间动词
使用过去时态.
When he arrived, I was having dinner.
I am arriving 进行时态表示将要

```
Exercises D
1 As my father ______ (leave) the house, the postman _______ (arrive).
was leaving；arrived(两个瞬间动词同时发生可能性很小, 应具体分析, 故用进行时态表将来)
5 While mother ______ (prepare) lunch, Janet ______ (set) the table.
set the table 摆桌子
was preparing；set
```
【Special Difficulties】
**短语动词中的小品词**
许多动词加上介词或副词后就会改变词义，这些介词和副词通常被称为小品词。它们没有词形的变化。 有
些小品词既可以作介词又可以作副词。判断一个小品词是副词还是介词要看小品词有没有带宾语。有宾 语的
是介词，没有宾语的是副词，介词的位置相对固定，不能变动。
① vi.&vt.+ prep./adv.+宾语(n.)
She is walking up the hill.
② vt.+宾语(n./pron.)+adv.
take off the coat =take the coat off =take it off
put on your shoes =put your shoes on =put them on
I always take money with me.我身上总带些钱


```
Exercise
11 They have pulled down the old building.
pull down... （pull<vt.>；down<adv.>）
pull one's leg 开玩笑
You are pulling my leg.你开我玩笑
12 Make up your mind.

【Text】
Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden
Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. Bill works harder than Joe
and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built
a wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I enter for the garden
competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!

参考译文
乔.桑德斯拥有我们镇上最漂亮的花园. 几乎每个人都参加每年举办的 “最佳花园竞赛” , 而每次都是
乔获胜. 比尔.弗里斯的花园比乔的花园大, 他比乔也更为勤奋, 种植的花卉和蔬菜也更多, 但乔的花园更富
有情趣. 他修筑了一条条整洁的小路, 并在一个池塘上架了一座小木桥. 我也喜欢花园, 但我却不愿意辛勤
劳动. 每年的花园竞赛我也参加, 但总因是镇上最劣的花园而获得一个小奖!


### 【课文讲解】

```
1 、Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.
Joe's garden is the most beautiful.
Bill's garden is the largest.
Bill’s garden is larger than Joe’s.
（比较的东西都是同类的事物 joe’s 的“’s”不能省略）
```
```
2 、Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time.
nearly 和almost 意义相似，表示“几乎”、“差不多”、“差点儿”的意思。
I have nearly forgotten his name. 我差点把他的名字忘了。
I’m nearly/almost ready. 我快准备好了。
enter for 报名参加（各种竞赛，考试等活动）
win（won，won） v. 赢
① vi. 赢
I win.
I lose. (输了)
② vt. 赢得......
win something 后面往往是奖品,不能接对手
I win the book.
I win the gold cup.
win a prize 赢得了一个奖
win a prize for... 因为......而获奖
defeat+对手
I defeat you.
```
3 、Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's.
名词加-’s 表示所属关系，构成名词的所有格。这类名词往往指有生命的东西，特别是人。所有格的语
法作用相当于形容词，限定后面的名词。这个被限定的名词在上下文中第二次被提到时可以省略，只要不
引起误解。

4 、He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.
make 和build 在这里是同义词，“修建，建造”。make 的词义比较笼统、广泛，可解释为“做、作出、
制造”等，而 build 主要限于建筑业，指“建造，建设，盖房子，修筑（桥梁）等”
Have you made the skirt by yourself?
They have made a road along the river.

【Key structures】
**形容词和副词的比较级和最高级**
比较级相当于汉语中“比......更......”这种句型，最高级则表示在某个范围“最......”的概念。最高
级在使用时前面通常要加定冠词 the，并有一个短语或从句限定其范围。
1 、比较级和最高级的构成：
① 单音节词和少数双音节词在词尾加-er，-est，以辅音加-y 结尾的词变-y 为-i，再加-er，-est
② 以-e 结尾的词加-r，-st


```
③ 以一个辅音字母结尾的单音节词要双写最后一个字母，再加-er，-est
④ 三个或者是三个音节以上（多音节）
```
比较级的构成 : more+原级
最高级的构成 : the most+原级
有一些双音节词既可在单词结尾加-er，-est，也可与 more/less 和 most/least 连用，如 narrow，clever，
common，pleasant 等。
clever— cleverer— more clever
fun adj. 快乐
more fun （美国人用）
⑤ 有些构成是不规则的：
good/well(better best)；bad/ill(worse worst)；many/much(more most)；little(less least)；
far(farther further , farthest furthest)
（farther:距离上的远和更远，further:程度上的更进一步）
further more(更有甚者)
old(older elder, oldest eldest)
older 比......大
She is older than somebody
elder 做定语修饰其他名词
elder sister (年长的)姐姐
2 、比较级和最高级的用法
在使用比较级时，如果需要把所比较的两项都提到，那么就必须比较级后用 than：
My room is cleaner than the one next door.
如果比较级之所指很清楚，它可独立存在：
Which house do you prefer?
I prefer the older one.
最高级的限定范围一般用 of，among，in 等介词短语；限定范围也可以是从句；如果范围很清楚，则
可以省略。
John is the tallest of the three brother.
This is the coldest day in ten years.
Mary is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met.

【Special Difficulties】
every **构成的合成词**
every 和 one，body，thing 可以构成复合不定代词 everyone，everybody，everything。Everyone 和 everybody
一般可以替换使用，后面的代词既可以用单数，也可以用复数，但它们本身均被视为单数。
Everyone/Everybody knows what he has to do.
=Everyone/Everybody knows what they have to do. 每个人都知道自己必须做什么。
Everything is going well. 一切都很顺利。
each 和 every 均可译为“每一个”，两者常可互换。every 只能是形容词性，强调整体，常用来指一个
大的、不确定的数目，不能直接做主语；each 既可作形容词，又可作代词，强调个体，常用以一个确定的并
通常是有限的数目，在作代词时，直接作主语或宾语，使用第三人称单数
Every/Each time I wash the car it rains.


```

We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord
is kept in the living room. It has belonged to our family for a long time. The instrument was bought by my
grandfather many years ago. Recently it was damaged by a visitor. She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys
too hard and two of the strings were broken. My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to touch it. It is
being repaired by a friend of my father's.

件乐器已经很久了, 是我祖父在很多年以前买的. 可它最近被一个客人弄坏了, 因为她用它来弹奏爵士乐.

词用时才能构成被动语态。如果要说明是什么人或什么东西做了某事，则用“by+行为主体”结构。“行 为主
体”也可以不表示出来。

### 双重所有格

双重所有格/双重属格 : 名词+of+名词所有格(名词性的物主代词)
英语中通常用-’s 和of 结构来表示所有格。-’s 结构通常用在人名和表示人称的名词的末尾，而 of 结构
则常与无生命的名词连用。

- ’s 结构的所有格可用于of 结构之后，称为双重所有格。在名词前面，可以用 a，this，that，these，some，
any，no 等，但不用 the。
He is a friend of mine. 含有“他是我的一个特殊的或惟一的朋友”之意。
He is no friend of mine. 含义是“我根本不认识他”或“他是我的敌人”
强调很多当中的一个或几个的时候, 选用双重属格结构
    a friend of my father/my father's friend(s) 只有一个朋友
    a friend of my father's 很多朋友中的一个
    It happened to a friend of mine. 我的很多朋友中的一个

early in the morning. He will be in his small boat, Topsail. Topsail is a famous little boat. It has sailed across the
Atlantic many times. Captain Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time. We'll see his boat
and then we'll say goodbye to him. He will be away for two months. We are very proud of him. He will take part
in an important race across the Atlantic.

于 8 点钟启航, 因此我们有充裕的时间. 我们将参观他的船, 然后和他告别. 他要离开两个月, 我们真为他
感到自豪, 他将参加一次重大的横渡大西洋的比赛.

【课文讲解】

I said hello to him this morning.
You must say sorry to somebody.
```
5 、He will be away for two months.
瞬间动词不是不能用完成时态, 而是指不能与段时间连用, 一旦要用段时间就要将其变为 “系表结构”
即 “be + 形容词或介词短语构成”


```
He has been away for two hours.
=He left two hours ago.点时间
有的动词可用be+形容词系表结构表状态来代替

① 基本结构: shall/will + 动词原形
shall 常用在第一人称 I 或 we 的后面，而 will 可用于所有人称，缩略为’ll，否定式中，will not 可缩略

示主语的意愿、决心、许诺等），将来进行时不具有这些含义，只表示单纯的将来，或者说只陈述将来的事
实，但它语气比单用 will 时委婉客气。
When will you finish these letters? （如上司对下属）
When will you be seeing Mr. White? （如下属对上司）

Mary won’t be paying this bill. （将来的事实）

【Text】
I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the
next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into
the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do
not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young
man suddenly said, very slowly, "Do you speak English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!'

参考译文
去年我有过一次有趣的经历. 在离开法国南部的一个小村庄后, 我继续驶往下一个城镇. 途中, 一个青
年人向我招手. 我把车停下, 他向我提出要求搭车. 他一上车, 我就用法语向他问早上好, 他也同样用法语回
答我. 除了个别几个单词外, 我根本不会法语. 旅途中我们谁也没讲话. 就要到达那个镇时, 那青年突然开了
口, 慢慢地说道 : “你会讲英语吗?”我很快了解到, 他自己就是个英国人!

【课文讲解】


1 、After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town.
after 引导的从句如果一个是过去时，一个是过去完成时，那一定是从句用过去完成时；before 引导的
从句表示“在......之前”，主句发生在从句之前, 主句用过去完成时。
drive on 继续开往（on 加在动词的后面表示继续）
My heart will go on 《我心永恒》
drive to 开车去某地
副词 on 紧跟在动词后面时可以表示“向前”、“继续下去”等意义：
He talked on until everybody had gone. 他滔滔不绝地讲到大家都走了。
I was reading when my friend called. After he had gone, I went on to read.
我朋友来看我时我正在看书。他走了以后我便继续看书。
表达方位的表达方式一共有 3 个介词, in（在......里面）,on（接壤），to（没有相接的, 是相离的）
A is to the east of B A 在B 的东方（A 与B 不相接）
A is on the east of B A 在 B 的东方（A 与 B 接壤）
A is in the east of B A 在B 的东方（A 在B 的里面）

```
2 、On the way, a young man waved to me.
on the way 在路上, 在途中
wave to sb. 冲某人挥手
```
3 、 As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same
language.
as soon as 一......就......，后面一定要加一个句子(时间状语从句), 强调两个动作几乎是连在一起
的，“一” 后面的先发生
As soon as I had entered the room,I took off my coat at once.
As soon as I had received the letter,I ringed/called him back.
只要是状语从句, 一旦遇到将来时, 变为一般现在时
As soon as you arrive,you must call me. 你一到就打我电话
表示用某种语言作为交际手段时介词用 in，表示讲某种语言时可以不加介词。I
speak English. I say a word in Chinese.
That book is written in German.
reply 要想加宾语要加 to (+要回答的内容)，而 in the same language 在句中作状语, 不是 replay 所应回
答的问题(宾语), 故用 in

```
4 、Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all.
apart from... 除......以外
not ... at all 一点都不，表强调
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
```
```
5 、I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, "Do you speak English?'
nearly 将要
when 的翻译要看当时的具体情况, 在这里译为“就在此时”
```

```
I had nearly reached home when I found my mother standing there.
```
```
Do you speak English? 你说英语吗? 你是说英语国家的人吗?（问的是一个事实，不是问会说英语吗）
Do you swim? 你去游泳吗?
Can you swim? 你会游泳吗?
```
```
6 、As I soon learnt, he was English himself!'
I learn 我得知； I know 我知道(我本来就知道)
As+主语+动词，从句 （As my mother said/As I heard/ As I learnt） 正如......
As we know,the New Concept English is very good. 正如我们所知......
As I think,it is the coldest day in the year.
As he said, English is easy to learn.
himself 反身代词单独放在句尾, 起强调作用
I read English myself.
```
【Key structures】
**过去完成时**
过去完成时：由 had+过去分词构成，它表示过去某时或某动作发生之前已经完成的动作或情况，即“较
早的过去”。过去完成时一定要以一个过去时态作铺垫, 这个动作一定要发生在 had done 之后。
在用过去完成时态的句子中，常用连词 when，after，as soon as，until，by that time 等。常与现在完成
时连用的副词如already，just，never，never...before 也常与过去完成时连用，以强调事件发生的先后次序：
I didn’t know that she was a famous actress until you had told me.
The boys loved the zoo. They had never seen wild animals before.
在那些用过去完成时的句子中没有明确的时间状语，但通过上下文可以看出动作发生的先后。

```
Exercises D (用正确的时态填空)
1 The moment he had said this, he ___ (regret) it.
the moment = as soon as 一......就......，后面直接加从句
2 It ______ (begin) to rain before she took a taxi.
before 引导的从句用一般过去时, 主句用过去完成时
```
【Special Difficulties】
Ask **与** Ask For **：**
ask v. 问，询问；请求，要求，邀请
ask a question/ask sb. 问（一个问题）/问某人
I asked (Mary) a question.
They asked Tony to sing a song.
They asked her to spend the weekend with them.
ask for 要，要求（某样东西）
ask for the answer
I asked for a cup of coffee, but they gave me a cup of tea.


```
You are always asking for help.
```
Except, Except for **与** Apart from
三者都表示“除......以外”，有时可以互换，但 except 不用于句首，except for 和 apart from 则可以。
Everyone has helped in some way apart from/except for/except you.
Apart from/Except for you, everyone has helped in some way.
apart from 习惯上喜欢放句首, apart from=except/besides
如果认为整体之中做这件事情的人除了整体之外，还有这个人也做了（包括），是加号=besides；如果
认为整体之中做这件事情的人除了整体之外，这个人没有做（排除），是减号=except；如果放在句首，统
一用apart from 代替 except/besides
All the passengers are millionaire except us. （减号）
I invited everyone except George. / Except for George I invited everyone.
Except for/apart from this, everything is in order.
except for 含有对整体中的某一个方面不满意，except for 可以不放在句首, 强调整体当中某一方面除外,
剩下的整体都不错
The article is very good except for his handwriing.
Except for his height, he is very excellent.

Which of **，** Either of **，** Neigher of **与** Both of
上面这些短语都可用于指两个人或两件事
either of 两者当中的任何一个
neither of 两者都不
which of 那一个
both of 两者都
① 当询问在两个或更多的人或事物中偏爱哪一个或选择哪一个时，可用 which
I like both of these bags. Which of the two do you prefer?
② either 与 neither 都是对两个人或物而言（后接单数名词）。either 指 one or the other（不是这个就是那
个），either 和 neither 后跟 of 时则指两个事物中的每一个
either of sb. ......当中的任何一个
neither of sb. ......当中的任何一个都不（neither of（注意英音与美音的读音）两者之间都不, 一旦
出现, 这句话里面不会再出现 not）
I don't like the book. My sister doesn't like it either.
Neither of us likes it. (注意要用单数)
Which bag shall I use?
Either of them. It doesn’t matter which. 哪个都行。用哪个都没关系。
Neither of them. Use a suitcase. 哪个都不行。用个手提箱吧。
③ both 只指两个人或物。当它用在名词前时，of 可有可无；当用在代词前面时，其后必须加 of
Both books/Both of the books are interesting.
Both of us/them left early.
④none of 三者或三者以上之间都不

The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He
did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me
that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had
come.
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he said.
Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

抬. 待我坐下后, 他说生意非常不景气. 他还告诉我, 公司支付不起这么庞大的工资开支, 有 20 个人已经
离去. 我知道这次该轮到我了.
“哈姆斯沃斯先生, “我无力地说.
“不要打断我的话, “他说.
然后他微笑了一下告诉我说, 我每年将得到 1,000 英镑的额外收入.

【课文讲解】

On Sundays, I usually get some extra sleep.
Last month, he was paid an extra hundred pounds.
② two others = two other +名词

或不跟 to+讲话对象。
1 、主从一致 : 主句和从句的时态一致
① 主句的动词为一般现在时, 从句为任意时态
② 主句的动词为一般过去时, 从句为相对应的过去时态（时态倒移）

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets
you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite. During a
holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: 'sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You
will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.' If you receive a
request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!

有时态和人称变化，通常只用于现在时和将来时。在其他时态时，must 的有些含义可以用 have to 或 have got to。
这三种形式一般可以互换，但用于第一人称时，have to(have got to)强调客观的要求或外在的原因， must
则强调主观的要求或表示说话的人认为自己有权做某事。
have to 和have got to 往往可以互换，但与 always，sometimes 等频度副词连用时，用 have to 往往比用
havt got to 好。have got to 比 have to 更口语化。

Must you leave now? 难道你非得现在就走吗？
I’m afraid so. I have to study for an exam.
must 可以表示推测，must do 表示对现在的推测；must have done 表示对过去的推测
He must be mad.
在 I think.../he thinks...的从句中，一定要用事实说话. (不能说成 “I think he must be a fool.” )
must be 的否定式为 can’t be（不可能）：
Someone’s using the phone, it must be John.
It can’t be John. He promised me he wouldn’t use it today.

【Text】
Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me.
Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I
never catch anything -- not even old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with
an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing!' my friends say. 'It's a waste of time.' But they don't realize one
important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at
all!

参考译文
钓鱼是我特别喜爱的一项运动. 我经常一钓数小时却一无所获, 但我从不为此烦恼. 有些垂钓者就是不
走运, 他们往往鱼钓不到, 却钓上来些旧靴子和垃圾. 我的运气甚至还不及他们. 我什么东西也未钓到过 --
就连旧靴子也没有. 我总是在河上呆上整整一上午, 然后空着袋子回家. “你可别再钓鱼了!” 我的朋友们说,
“这是浪费时间. “然而他们没有认识到重要的一点, 我并不是真的对钓鱼有兴趣, 我感兴趣的只是独坐孤舟,
无所事事!

【课文讲解】
1 、Fishing is my favourite sport.
fishing 是一个动名词，由动词+ing 组成，动名词可以作主语或宾语，如 eating，reading 等等
★ fish
① n. 鱼（不可数名词），鱼的种类（可数）
There are a lot of fishes(表示种类)in the sea.
② v. 钓鱼, 捕鱼

2 、I often fish for hours without catching anything.
for+时间 表示一段时间
for hours=for some hours 数小时
without catching anything 作为状语而出现, 表示结果状语。without 是介词，后面一定要加宾语, 动名词
catching 作 without 的宾语，without 后面的动作是主语来做的。动名词也有动词的特性，可以有自己的宾
语。
without 通常表示“缺乏、没有”；当它位于动名词前时，表示“不曾、不”
I can’t repair the car without your help.
They tried to leave the restaurant without paying.
He went out without saying any words.

【Key structures】
**动名词**
动词+ing 作名词时称为动名词，它仍有动词的属性，可以接宾语，动名词可以代替名词做主语和宾语
或介词宾语。

Watching television is my favourite pastime. 看电视是我最喜爱的业余爱好. 2 、
动名词作宾语

3 、利用介词/副词+动名词可以把两个句子连成一个句子
apologize for (not) doing sth. 为什么事情而道歉
I must apologize. I interrupted you. 我得表示道歉. 我打断了你的说话(工作).
I must apologize for interrupting you.
由于打断了你的说话(工作), 我得表示道歉. （for interrupting 强调 interrupt 这个动词）

时间 (having done)）
以上两者为时间概念不同，意思相同
congratulate (sb.) on doing sth. 因......祝贺（某人）
He congratulated me. I won the competition. 他向我道贺. 我赢得了这次比赛.
He congratulated me on winning the competition. 在我赢得这次比赛之际, 他向我祝贺.

congratulations on doing sth. （祝贺......）

```
night and day. The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it
came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven from their homes by the noise. I am one of the
few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been offered a
large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody says I must be mad and they are
probably right.

参考译文
飞机正在逐渐把我逼疯. 我住在一个机场附近, 过往飞机日夜不绝于耳. 机场是许多年前建的, 但由于
某种原因当时未能启用. 然而去年机场开始使用了. 有 100 多人肯定是被噪音逼得已经弃家远去, 我是少
数留下来的人中的一个. 有时我觉得这房子就要被一架飞过的飞机撞倒. 他们曾向我提供一大笔钱让我搬
走, 但我决定留在这儿. 大家都说我肯定是疯了, 也许他们说的是对的.

```
【课文讲解】
1 、Mad or not? = mad or not mad?

4 、The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then.

【Key structures】
**被动语态**
被动语态可以和大部分情态动词连用（包括具有情态功能的 will 和 would）。

动词+宾语+不定式结构中既可以动词用被动语态，也可以在不定式中用被动语态：
Mary was told to meet us. = They told Mary meet us.
在句型“动词+间接宾语+直接宾语”中，这两个宾语都可以成为被动句的主语。但由于间接宾语通常
是人，所以间接宾语成为被动句主语的时候要多些：

Work on it had begun before my sister left. The house was completed five months ago. In my letter, I told her that

There is and It is
在说明或询问人或物等的存在时可用 there be 结构。这种结构可以用一般现在时、一般过去时、一般

There’s a bus coming, but it’s full.
There’s a man at the door. It’s the postman.
it 作为“虚主语”表示时间、距离、天气等概念时，不能用 there be 结构
It’s fifteen miles to the station.

```
Exercise(用 it 或there 填空)
3 were some men digging up the road outside my house.
there : There+be+sb.+doing+地点 : 某地有某人正在做某事(典型句型)
digging up: 挖出, 找出
4 Look at those clouds. I think ___ will be a thunderstorm.

I entered the hotel manager's office and sat down. I had just lost $50 and I felt very upset. 'I left the money in
my room,' I said, 'and it's not there now.' The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing. 'Everyone's
losing money these days,' he said. He started to complain about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock
at the door. A girl came in and put an envelope on his desk. It contained $50. 'I found this outside this gentleman's
room,' she said. 'Well,' I said to the manager, 'there is still some honesty in this world!'

【Text】
I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel,
so I asked a porter. I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could
not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me, but he spoke
neither slowly nor clearly. 'I am a foreigner,' I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My
teacher never spoke English like that! The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something
and I understood it. 'You'll soon learn English!' he said. I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different
language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?

参考译文
我终于到了伦敦. 火车站很大, 又黑又暗. 我不知道去饭店的路该怎么走, 于是向一个搬运工打听. 我的
英语讲得不但非常认真, 而且咬字也非常清楚. 然而搬运工却不明白我的话. 我把问话重复了很多遍. 他终
于听懂了. 他回答了, 但他讲得既不慢也不清楚. “我是个外国人, “我说. 于是他说得慢了, 可我还是听不懂.
我的老师从来不那样讲英语!我和搬运工相视一笑. 接着, 他说了点什么, 这回我听懂了. “您会很快学会英
语的!” 他说. 我感到奇怪. 在英国, 人们各自说着一种不同的语言. 英国人之间相互听得懂, 可我却不懂他们
的话!他们说的是英语吗?

【课文讲解】
1 、Do the English speak English?
English 这里均为名词，第一个指“英国人”，前面要加 the，表示一个群体，后面的动词必须用复数；
第二个指“英语”，指语言时前面不加冠词。

与 English 相似的单词有French，Chinese，Japanese 等。

2 、I arrived in London at last.

home/there”，如一定要这样写则把“home”看作名词，“there”当代词看, 不作副词看
get home 到家；get there 到那

```
3 、The railway station was big, black and dark.
并列的表达方式中前面都是用逗号隔开, 最后两个用and 连接
balck 颜色(建筑物)
The room is black.
```

```
dark 没有光线

```

the way to ... 通往......路
Can you tell me the way to...
I don't know the way to.... Can you tell me how to get there?
I don't know the way to the school and where is it?

I can speak not only Chinese but English as well.
Mary not only found her aunt, but stayed with her for two weeks as well.
Not only you but also I will go there.主语并列(一般不这么用)
not only 喜欢放在动词的前面，一般遇到实义动词和非实义动词的时候, 习惯放在两者之间

I not only like my mother but my father as well.
as well 本身的含义是“也、又、还”

【Key structures】
**并列句中的语序**
通过并列连词可以把几个简单句连接起来构成一个并列句。在并列句中，各分句要根据上下文的要求
按逻辑次序排列，但各分句都同等重要并独立存在。
并列连词可以用来表示另加（and）、对比（but，yet）、选择（or）、连续（and，then）以及结局或结果
（so）。
however 用在句号的后面, 单独成句, 于前边的句子只有意思上的承接, 没有语法上的承接, 语法上的
承接表转折只能用 but
一些并列句的连词：and，and then，but，so，yet，or，not only...but...as well 不但......而且......，
neither...nor... 既不......也不......，either...or... 或者......或者......，both...and... 两者都
yet adv. 然而
放在句末或句中, 与否定句, 疑问句相连, 并且与现在完成时用得比较多
Have you finished yet?
yet=but 连词，放在两个句子间, 起转折作用
or adv. 或者, 否则
Hurry up ,you will be late. /Hurry up,or you will be late.
当主语由 and 或 both...and 连接, 通常采用复数谓语动词.
Both the girl and the boy are his friends.
当主语由 neither...nor,either...or,not only...but also 或 or 连接时，谓语动词与 nor,or,but also 后面的词一
致，在英语语法中，这被称之为“就近原则”，离动词最近的名词是单数, 整个主语就视为单数；离动词最
近的名词是复数, 整个主语就视为复数
Neither he nor I am going to the airport.
Not only Mary but also her parents have jgone abroad.

【Multiple choice questions】
5 He didn't speak slowly and he didn't speak clearly _b___.
a. neither b. either c. too d. nor
not 和 neither 不会连用，too 用于肯定句，either 用于跟否定句结尾
一句话中一般不允许出现两个否定句

```
8 I repeated my question several times. I repeated it ___b___ times.
a. much b. a number of c. only a few d. three
several = some = a number of
much 后面不加可数名词，没有 only a few 这个短语，quite a few 相当多的
```
```
9 At last he understood. He understood _ a___.
a. in the end b. at least c. lastly d. at the finish
```

```
at last= in the end 最后、最终
lastly adj. 最新的、最近的一段时间
at least 至少
```
```
【语法精粹】
```
1. They _ B__ the trip until the rain stopped.
A. continued B. didn't continue C. hadn't continued D. would continue
until 是前面和后面用一般过去时和过去完成时都对，但是我们在一般情况下两个都用一般过去时
2. The local peasants gave the solders clothes and food without which they __A_ of hunger and cold.
(without 在这里表示条件)
A. would die B. will die C. would be dead D. would have died
虚拟语气
3. It was not until then that I came to know that the earth __D__around the sun.
A. moved B. has moved C. will move D. moves
It was not until that 是强调结构,首先将“It was...that”去掉，再将“not”移到“that”后面的句子中，分
析句子时后半句改为 :
I didn't come to know that the earth around the sun until then.
（until then 是在那个时候之前）
His father did not leave until he returned home.
变成强调句形式 : It was not until he returned home that his father left.
I don't get up until lunch time.
变成强调句形式 : It is not until lunch time that I get up.
4. When all those present(到场者) D__he begin his lecture.
A. sit B. set C. seated D. were seated
seat vt. 做动词的时候两种情况① seat sb.；② sb. be seated

【Text】
I am an art student and I paint a lot of pictures. Many people pretend that they understand modern art. They
always tell you what a picture is 'about'. Of course, many pictures are not 'about' anything. They are just pretty
patterns. We like them in the same way that we like pretty curtain material. I think that young children often
appreciate modern pictures better than anyone else. They notice more. My sister is only seven, but she always tells
me whether my pictures are good or not. She came into my room yesterday.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'I'm hanging this picture on the wall,' I answered. 'It's a new one. Do you like it?'
She looked at it critically for a moment. 'It's all right,' she said, 'but isn't it upside down?'
I looked at it again. She was right! It was!

参考译文
我是个学艺术的学生, 画了很多画. 有很多人装成很懂现代艺术的样子, 总是告诉你一幅画的 “意思”
是什么. 当然, 有很多画是什么 “意思” 也没有的. 它们就是些好看的图案, 我们喜爱它们就像我们喜欢漂
亮的窗帘布一样. 我觉得小孩子们往往比任何人都更能欣赏现代绘画, 他们观察到的东西更多. 我的妹妹只
有 7 岁, 但她总能说出我的画是好还是坏. 昨天她到我房里来了.

【课文讲解】
1 、They are just pretty patterns.
just 在此处指“只是，仅仅（是）”

I love you in the same way that I love my father.

They can appreciate modern arts best.

用比较级表示最高级：
The teacher is the tallest.
The teacher is taller than anyone else. (“else”不能少, 把主语从“anyone”中排除)
The book is more expensive than anything else.

I don’t know whether you are interested (in it) or not.
You must help him, whether you like him or not.
不管你是否喜欢他，你（都）必须帮助他。
```
```
5 、'I'm hanging this picture on the wall,' I answered.

```
6 、'It's all right,' she said, 'but isn't it upside down?'

达一种情绪
Aren't you lucky? 你真幸运

Late in the afternoon, the boys put up their tent in the middle of a field. As soon as this was done, they cooked
a meal over an open fire. They were all hungry and the food smelled good. After a wonderful meal, they told
stories and sang songs by the campfire. But some time later it began to rain. The boys felt tired so they put out the
fire and crept into their tent. Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable, so they all slept soundly. In the
middle of the night, two boys woke up and began shouting. The tent was full of water! They all leapt out of their
sleeping bags and hurried outside. It was raining heavily and they found that a stream had formed in the field. The
stream wound its way across the field and then flowed right under their tent!

【Text】
Jasper White is one of those rare people who believe in ancient myths. He has just bought a new house in the
city, but ever since he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners. When he returns home at night, he
always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate. Because of this, he has not been able to get his own
car into his garage even once. Jasper has put up 'No Parking' signs outside his gate, but these have not had any
effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen. I asked him
what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. Jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to
stone. But none of them has been turned to stone yet!

及车主们发生了磨擦. 当他夜里回到家时, 总是发现有人把车停在他家大门外. 为此, 他甚至一次也没能把
自己的车开进车库. 贾斯珀曾把几块 “禁止停车” 的牌子挂在大门外边, 但没有任何效果. 现在他把一个丑
陋的石雕头像放在了大门上边, 这是我见过的最丑陋的头像之一. 我问他那是什么?他告诉我那是蛇发女怪

如果在定语从句中出现了 one of 作为先行词, 它后边的关系代词指代的是后面的复数名词；如果在 one
of 前面还有一修饰词 (the) only,那么后边的关系代词将指代 one 这个词, 才作单数看
He is the only one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths.
one of 直接作主语的时候, 它是做单数看待的

【Text】
Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service.The 'taxi' is a small Swiss
aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers. The most surprising thing
about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field. Captain Fawcett's first
passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then,
Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places. Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and
on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a
businessman. The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not
take him because the trip was too dangerous.

The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home. I like sitting by the Wayle on fine
afternoons. It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children were playing
games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river. Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball
very hard and it went towards a passing boat. Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he
did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water. I turned to look at the children, but
there weren't any in sight: they had all run away! The man laughed when he realized what had happened. He
called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.

【Text】
Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences as a young man. Before he retired,
Frank was the head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop. It was his job
to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day. He saved money for years and in 1958 he
bought a small workshop of his own. In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes. At that time
he had two helpers. In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred
and twenty-eight people. Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success. He
was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!

【Text】
People are not so honest as they once were. The temptation to steal is greater than ever before--especially in
large shops. A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday
mornings. One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier
for the detective to watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she chose one of the
most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.
Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was arrested, the
detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter. The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!

侦探最近注意上了一位穿着讲究的妇女, 她总是在星期一上午进入一家大商场. 有一个星期一, 当这位妇女
走进这家商场时, 里面的人比往常少, 因此, 侦探比较容易监视她. 这位妇女先是买了几样小商品. 过了一会
几, 她又选了商场里最昂贵的一件衣服, 把它递给了售货员. 那售货员以最快的速度为她包好了衣服. 然后,
那妇女拿过包就走出了商场, 根本没有付钱. 她被逮捕后, 侦探发现原来那售货员是她的女儿. 那姑娘每星

```
as...as...的否定形式是 not so...as.../not as...as...

```
```
3 、The temptation to steal is greater than ever before--especially in large shops.
the temptation to steal 偷窃的诱惑力

mornings.
watch v. 观察, 监视; 当心(口语中)
watch the enemy
watch sth. 当心
Watch your head! (威胁)
“well+动词的过去分词”组成复合形容词，做定语
well-designed 设计得不错
well-educated 有教养的

5 、One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for
the detective to watch her.
as usual 象平常 ；than usual 比平常
so it was easier for the detective to watch her. (句中用“easier”有潜在的比较含义，it 是形式主语，for sb.
中的sb.是逻辑主语
It be 动词+形容词+for sb. to do sth. 对某人来说做什么事......
The teacher bought a lot of dresses to make her more beautiful.
(更漂亮, 不用 “more” 时会让人产生误会，用 more 是表示对别人的尊重)
out of politeness 出于礼貌 (politeness n. 有礼, 优雅)


6 、 After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant
who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.
after a little time 过了一会儿
hand...to... 递给(比较有权威的人)
handed it to an assistant (前一个以 “o” 结尾, 后一个以 “元音” 开头的, 读时需再在它们之间加一
个[ ]音, 又如：my heart go on.)
pass sth. to sb. 一个一个的传递(更常用)
hand in 上交
wrap sth. up for sb. 为某人打包......

```
8 、The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!
free adj. 免费的
Children under five years old travel free. 5 岁以下儿童免费旅行。
fee adj. 交费
fee parking 收费的停车场
“once a +表示时间的名词”可以表示频率：
He comes to the office once a day.
```
【Key structures】
**比较状语从句**
比较状语从句含有或暗含有“与......相比”的意思。除了 than...或 more...than...这种结构外，它还包
括 as+形容词/副词+as...，not so/as...as...，less...than...等结构。当句子里两个动词相同、时态也一样时，
则第二个动词可以省略，比较从句就成了含蓄的从句。如果对比的东西很明显，那么为了避免重复，从句 中
有些成分、甚至整个从句都省略，因此这类句子往往不完整。
People aren’t so kind as they used to be.
No, they’re becoming less kind. 是的，他们变得不那么友善了。
He is as quick in answering as his sister (is).
He answers as quickly as his sister (does).
He is not so/as quick as his sister.

little **和** few **的用法**
little 和a little 与不可数名词一起使用。little 表示否定，有“几乎一点儿也没有”的含义，在口语中常
用 not much；a little 表示肯定，具有 some 的含义。
He has (very) little hope of winning this race.


=He hasn’t much hope of winning this race.
Have we got any bread?
Yes, there’s a little/some in the fridge.
few 和 a few 与复数可数名词连用。few 表示否定，与 little 相似，在口语中多用 not many；a few 表示
肯定，有 some 的含义。
They had few guests last weekend.
They didn’t have many guests last weekend.
little 的比较级为 less，few 的比较级为 fewer。
During the holiday, there is less noise in the building.
There are fewer travelers than there usually are.

【Special Difficulties】
A and One
不定冠词 a 通常用于表示不确定的人或事物以及第一次提到的人或事物，a 强调的是后面的名词； one
强调的是 “一个” 的意思：
It was one apple I ate, not two.
There is a book and a pen on the desk.
不表示强调时，a 和 one 有时可以互换：
She will come home in a/one week’s time.
叙述故事时常将 one+表示时间的名词用于句首，而不用 a：
One Monday, he went to the office as usual.

【Multiple choice questions】
4 There were fewer people in the shop than usual. There were ___b___.
a. as many as usual b. not as many as usual
c. as few as usual d. more than usual

```
7 It was one of the most expensive dresses ___a___ the shop.

【Text】
Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain what had happened to her. One afternoon she set out
from the coast in a small boat and was caught in a storm. Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl
jumped into the sea. Then she swam to the shore after spending the whole night in the water. During that time she
covered a distance of eight miles. Early next morning, she saw a light ahead. She knew she was near the shore
because the light was high up on the cliffs. On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light
she had seen. That was all she remembered. When she woke up a day later, she found herself in hospital.

As the thieves were trying to get away in their car, Roy drove his bus into the back of it. While the battered car
was moving away, Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police. The thieves' car was badly damaged and easy to
recognize. Shortly afterwards, the police stopped the car and both men were arrested.

参考译文
罗伊·特雷顿原是开出租汽车的, 然而就在前不久, 他开上了公共汽车, 也并不为此而感到后悔. 他发觉
自己的新工作令人兴奋得多. 最近, 当他正开车在凯特福德街上行驶时, 看到有两个小偷从一家商店里冲出
来, 奔向等在那里的一辆汽车, 其中一个提着一只装满钞票的提包. 罗伊行动迅速, 开车直冲窃贼而去. 拿钱
的那个小偷吓得把提包都扔了. 当那两个小偷企图乘车逃跑时, 罗伊驾驶他的公共汽车撞在了那辆车的后
尾上. 当那辆被撞坏的车开走后, 罗伊停下车, 给警察挂了电话. 小偷的车损坏严重, 很容易辨认. 没过多久,
警察就截住了那辆车, 两个小偷都被抓住了.

```
【课文讲解】
1 、A short while ago, however, he became a bus driver and he was not regretted it.
a short while ago＝a short time ago 不久以前
while 作名词表示“一会儿，（一段）时间”时常与 a 连用，有时也与 the，this 等连用：
They haven’t seen each other for a long while.
Have you been in Australia all this while?
I saw her a short while ago.
however 可以放句首, 可以放句中；如果一个词两边有逗号，证明这个词是插入语
```
2 、He is finding his new work far more exciting.
find 可以用一般现在时态, 可以用进行时态
He is finding his trip very exciting.
far more exciting 更有趣（在形容词和副词的比较级与最高级前面，可以用 far（相当 much）来表示强
调，译为“很，大大的”）
It’s far/much colder today than it was yesterday.
This is (by) far the most expensive bicycle in the shop.

3 、When he was driving along Catford Street recently, he saw two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a
waiting car.
see 和一些感知动词（如 smell, feel, hear, watch, notice 等）可以用在动词+名词/代词宾语+不带 to 的不
定式结构（省略 to）中，如果全过程用 do，过程中的一瞬间用 doing：
see sb. do sth. 看见某人做某事(强调全过程)
I see them dance. (看了全过程)


```
see sb. doing sth. 看见某人正在做某事
I see them dancing. (只看了一部分)
hear sb doing sth.，hear sb. do sth.
```
```
4 、The one with the money got such a fright that he dropped the bag.
with 一旦出现在名词或代词后就做定语, 出现在动词之后做状语
He came in with a book. (作状语)
The boy with a book came in. (作定语)
get a fright 吓了一跳
so+形容词(副词)+that.../such+(修饰词或形容词)+名词+that... 如此......以致......
一旦有名词, 就认为形容词修饰的是名词, 前面的词也修饰的是名词
drop vt. 由于抓什么没抓住不小心掉下去 （sb. drop sth.）
I drop the chalk.
fall vi. 从上往下落 （sth. fall）
drop the money / the money fall
The chalk is falling.
```
```
5 、As the thieves were trying to get away in their car, Roy drove his bus into the back of it.
as = when 当......时候
get away ＝ run away 逃跑
How did the thief get away?
by car /in the car 开车
drive into... 撞上......
```
```
6 、While the battered car was moving away, Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police.
stopped his car，the car stopped（与当时说话时的视觉概念有关，一个是人为停，一个是自己停下来）
```
7 、The thieves' car was badly damaged and easy to recognize.
...and easy to recognize = and the car was easy to recognize (用主动表被动含义)
如果一个不定式的前面是一个形容词, 如果主句的结局是“系表结构+to”，不定式当中常用主动表被动,
在不定式的表达方式当中, 动词的宾语如果刚好是这句话的主语, 这个宾语一定不能出现
The apple is sweet enough to eat.
The apple is too sour to eat. (sour adj. 酸的)
The question is easy enough to answer.
The boy is enough clever to answer the question.
这个小孩足够聪明以至于能回答这个问题。 （the question 不是主语故一定要出现）
文中 “...easy to recognize(car)” 因 car 是主语, 所以不能出现
在不定式当中, 也许有可能用主动表达被动含义, 及物动词后面一般加宾语(这个宾语就是这句话的主
语就不加), 又如：The clothes are too comfortable to ware.
8 、Shortly afterwards, the police stopped the car and both men were arrested.
shortly afterwards 没过多久
both men ＝ two persons


```
stop the car 拦住车子（the driver stop the car；其他人 stopped the car）
stop thief 捉賊
```
【Special difficulties】
So and Such
such 和so 都可以用于表示程度，但 so 只能作副词和连词，such 则是形容词，因此 so 通常位于形容词、
副词之前，而 such 只能位于名词之前：
I’ve never read so interesting a book.
I’ve never read such an interesting book.
引导结果状语从句时，它们的结构分别是：
so +形容词(副词) +that.../ such +(a, an 修饰词或形容词)+名词+that... 如此......以至于......
一旦有名词, 就认为形容词修饰的是名词, 前面的词也修饰的是名词，如果名词是可数名词单数才要加
a 和an, 反过来如果是可数名词单数, 前面一定要加 a 或 an
It was so cold that no one went out.
such 除了表示“这样的，如此的”等意思外，还可以表示“像这一类的”，so 不能表示这种意思。
He often talks about such things.
You should not speak to such people.
如果形容词是表示数量的(many, much, little, few), 一律用 so
There is so little time left that we must hurry.
There is such a little(小) bird that I can't see it.
(little 不会和可数名词连用，如连用不会译成“数量少”，而应译为“小”)
He is so lazy a boy./ He is such a lazy boy.
如果有几个以上的形容词共同修饰一个名词的时候, 冠词放在第一位, 这句话中冠词不放在第一位, 说
明 “a” 与 “boy” 有关系, “lazy” 从意思上与 “boy” 有关系, 但从强调点上与 “boy” 没关系, 它的强调点在
“lazy” 上

I’ll have left by Monday. 到星期一我将已离开。（星期一之前的任何时间）
I won’t have left by Monday. 我星期一之前不会离开。 （星期一还在）

5 、Everybody will be watching anxiously as the new buildings go up.
as 是连词，相当于 while，当“当，正值”讲，引出时间状语从句，它引导的从句虽然表示将来的动作
但要用一般现在时，不能用 “...will go up”
be built 强调建造；go up （建筑物）被兴建起来，拔地而起
Many new houses are going up in this district.


6 、We are all very excited and are looking forward to the Olympic Games because they have never been held
before in this country.
look forward to+n./pron./doing sth. (很高兴的)盼望，期待
look forward to...与 expect(期待)的区别是 expect 没有高不高兴的成分
Look forward to your letter.

【Text】
My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England. He had
often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner returned
than he bought a house and went to live there. Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for
even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. After so many years of
sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted as if he had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than
he could bear. He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The dream he
had had for so many


years ended there. Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.

参考译文
我的老朋友哈里森在回到英国以前曾多年居住在地中海地区。过去他常幻想退休后到英国，并计划在
乡间安顿下来。他刚一回到英国便买下了一幢房子住了进去。但紧接着他就开始抱怨那里的天气了。因为 即
使那时仍为夏季，但雨总是下个不停，而且常常冷得厉害。在阳光下生活了那么多年的哈里森对此感到 惊奇。
他的举动就好像他从未在英国生活过一样。最后，他再也忍受不住，还没等安顿下来就卖掉了房子， 离开了
这个国家。他多年来的幻想从此破灭。哈里森把每件事情都考虑到了，唯独没想到天气。

【课文讲解】
1 、He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country.
dream of... 想, 梦见(梦想)，幻想，向往
Frank used to dream of having a car of his own.
think of... 想(思维的活动), 考虑
settle down 定居，安身，安顿
After two years of traveling, I want to settle down now.

2 、He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there.
no sooner...than... 一......就......（关联词，引导时间状语从句，主句里常用过去完成时，than
后面的从句用一般过去时），相同用法的还有 as soon as，the moment，on doing
had no sooner done...than +一般过去时, 固定用法 (时态结构 : 完成时态 + than + 一般过去时)
He had no sooner arrived than he called me up.
no sooner 放在句首就要倒装
No sooner had he arrived than he called me up. (倒装)

3 、Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained
continually and it was often bitterly cold.
almost immediately 几乎马上, 很快地 (时间上的快, 常用于写作)
for（连词）表示因为(解释说明, 附加的)＝because 因为（一定要说的原因），for 与 because 不同，不能
用于句首，并且在 for 后面必须重复主语：
I don’t have a car, for I can’t afford it.
even though =even if 即使，虽然（引导让步状语从句）
Even though I came here, my mind was absent. 尽管我人来了, 但我还是心不在焉

```
4 、After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock.
so many years 这么多年
after it rained for days = after so many days of rain 在这么多天雨之后
After seven years of hard work, he was successful.
After ten years of staying in abroad, he decided to return and settle down.
got a shock 吓了一跳, 吃了一惊
```
```
5 、He acted as if he had never lived in England before.
as if+句子 似乎, 好像（引导表示方式的状语从句，如果从句为过去完成时则是虚拟语气，描述
```

与事实相反, 后面的条件是假的）
He acted as if he was poor. (as if 后是真是假, 应根据上下文来看)
My leg hurts as if it was broken.
连词 as if/though 引导方式状语从句，通常跟在描述行为举止的动词之后，如 act，appear，feel，look，
smell，sound 等后面：
She acted as if she were mad. （虚拟语气）
It feels as if/though it’s going to rain.

```
6 、In the end, it was more than he could bear.
more than 在这里表示“超过......的范围”
This piece of news is more than I can believe.
It was more than I could understand.
I can't affard it. ＝ It was more than I can affard.
这种用法与它通常表示“比......更多”的用法稍有不同：
There were more than ten people in the room.
```
```
7 、He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country.
hardly...when... 还没来得及......就......，用法同 no sooner...than
hardly had sb. done when... (hardly 在句首, 要倒装)
He had hardly opened his eyes when he was knocked out.（knock out : 打晕, 击倒）
have time to do sth. 有时间做某事
I have no time to talk with you. 我没时间和你说话
I have time enough to have coffee. 我有足够的时间喝咖啡

2 The engine was worn out. The gearbox was full of sawdust. (The engine...not only...but...as well)
3 He could not drive it. He could no sell it. He could not even give it away. (neither...nor...nor)

1. in a bad state 状态不太好
though 虽然, even though＝even if 即使，这些词出现在两句之间, 就不再加 but，
2. The engine was not only worn out but the gearbox was full of sawdust.
worn out 破旧不堪的
engine n. 发动机, 机车, 火车头
gearbox n. 变速箱
sawdust n. 锯屑, 木头屑子 （saw n. 锯；v. 锯）
not only 出现在句首要倒装,一般不会放在句首
3. He could neither drive it nor sell it nor even give it away.
He could neither drive it nor sell it even nor give it away. (这样写更好)
neither do sth. nor do sth. nor do sth. 既不能也不能更不能

He hadn’t finished it by yesterday evening. 到昨天晚上他还没做完。
I’d never flown a plane at all until I flew this one!
在驾驶这架飞机之前我从来没有驾驶过飞机！

【Special Difficulties】
No sooner **...** than and Hardly **...** when
no sooner...than (一......就......)；hardly...when (几乎未来得及......就......)这两组连词意义都和 as soon
as 相近，但比 as soon as 正式。它们通常都与过去完成时连用。当 no sooner 和 hardly 位于句首时，后面的
主谓结构都要颠倒顺序，即句子变为 no sooner/hardly +助动词 +主语 +动词形式的语序。
No sooner had he begun speaking than he was interrupted. 他刚一开始讲话就被打断了。
Hardly had he got into the bus when it began moving.

```

【Text】
While John Gilbert was in hospital, he asked his doctor to tell him whether his operation had been successful,
but the doctor refused to do so. The following day, the patient asked for a bedside telephone. When he was alone,
he telephoned the hospital exchange and asked for Doctor Millington. When the doctor answered the phone, Mr.
Gilbert said he was inquiring about a certain patient, a Mr. John Gilbert. He asked if Mr. Gilbert's operation had
been successful and the doctor told him that it had been. He then asked when Mr. Gilbert would be allowed to go
home and the doctor told him that he would have to stay in hosptial for another two weeks. Then Dr. Millington
asked the caller if he was a relative of the patient. 'No,' the patient answered, 'I am Mr. John Gilbert.'

参考译文
当约翰·吉尔伯特住院的时候, 他问医生他的手术是否成功, 但医生拒绝告诉他. 第二天, 这位病人要
了一部床头电话. 当房里只剩他一个人时, 他挂通了医院的交换台, 要求与米灵顿医生讲话. 当这位医生
接过电话时, 吉尔伯特先生说他想询问一个病人的情况, 是一位名叫约翰·吉尔伯特的先生. 他问吉尔伯特
先生的手术是否成功, 医生告诉他手术很成功. 然后他又问吉尔伯特先生什么时候可以回家, 医生说他在
医院还必须再住上两个星期. 之后, 米灵顿医生问打电话的人是否是病人的亲属. “不是, “病人回答说, “我
就是约翰·吉尔伯特先生. “

```
【课文讲解】
1 、Am I all right?
all right 当指人的健康状况时，可表示“安然无恙的，良好的”
I was not very well last week, but I feel all right now.
```
2 、 While John Gilbert was in hospital, he asked his doctor to tell him whether his operation had been
successful, but the doctor refused to do so.
So 在这里是代词，代替前面的动词不定式（to tell him whether...）。它一般出现 believe，do，expect，
hope，say，tell，think，appear 等之后：
Is it true that John has had an operation?
I am afraid so. /I believe so. / I think so. / It seems so.

```
3 、The following day, the patient asked for a bedside telephone.
```

the following day = the next day，这里 following 表示“紧接着的，其次的”。
ask for 请求，索要，要求（得到某个东西）。在下一句（...asked for Doctor Millington）中它表示“要
求（某人）来（接电话）”。
bedside telephone 床头电话

4 、When the doctor answered the phone, Mr. Gilbert said he was inquiring about a certain patient, a Mr. John
Gilbert.
Certain 在这里没有“肯定的，确实的”等含义，而表示“某一，某位”，暗指说话者或说话对象可能
对这人/这事不大清楚/熟悉，或所指的这个人身份不大清楚：
Mary years ago a certain doctor arrived in London.
a Mr. John Gilbert 一位名叫约翰.吉尔伯特的先生
a+人名前面, 表示某一个拥有这个特征的人或我不认识的某某人，这种情况下 a 通常与表示“某一”
的 certain 连用：
He is a Leifeng. 表示具有雷锋的特征
A certain Mrs. Hart is waiting to see you.
有位哈特夫人正等着见您。

5 、He then asked when Mr. Gilbert would be allowed to go home and the doctor told him that he would have
to stay in hosptial for another two weeks.
for another two weeks 又两个星期
another 作为限定词表示“另一个，再一个”的时候，通常与可数的单数名词连用，不和复数形式连用；
但是后面可以跟基数词/few+复数名词（它们被当成一个整体）：
I need another three driving lessons before my test.
考试前我还需上 3 节驾驶课。
I need another few hours before I can finish my homework.
我还需几个小时才能做完作业。

【Key structures】
**直接引语和间接引语**
直接引语的疑问句变为间接引语的疑问句时引号和问号不再使用，且直接疑问句中的倒装语序在转述
疑问句里要还原为陈述句语序（主语+动词），有必要还要改变时态。
转述一般疑问句时必须使用 if 或 whether，不可省略，助动词 do/does 和did 在转述疑问句里消失了。
She asked if/whether you were tired. 她问你是否感到疲劳.
ask，want to know，wonder 等后面的 if 和 whether 通常可以互换，但是 whether 表示的怀疑程度比 if
稍大。
I wonder if/whether he’s phoned the doctor.
在表示两者挑一时更常用 whether：
She asked me whether I wanted tea or coffee.
转述疑问句中带有 or not 时，通常用 whether 引导，不用 if 引导：
He wants to know whether or not we want dinner.
Did the children say they’d eaten? 他们没告诉我他们吃了没有。
在转述特殊疑问句时，通常用原来的疑问词。在针对主语提问的间接疑问句中，时态和情态助动词照


### 常有变化，但语序保持不变。

Tom asked if / whether Jack would arrive the next day. 汤姆问杰克第二天是否能到.
Jane asked why I hadn't written to her. 简问为什么我不给她写信.
如果直接引语是问句，变为间接引语时，主句不说 He said，而用 He asked；told 可以后跟问句，还可
以跟陈述句：
直接引语是表示命令、请求、建议的祈使句通常可用适当的动词后跟不定式来转述，常用的这类动词
有 advise，ask，tell，order，command，warm，invite 等，这些动词后往往有间接宾语，在转述这类祈使句的
否定形式时，必须将 not 放在带 to 的不定式之前：
She reminded/told me to turn off all the lights.
The teacher was telling/ordering/commanding her students to close their books.
tell sb. to do sth.
The teacher told me (not) to open the door.
ask sb. to do sth.
动词 suggest 和 insist 用于转述建议、要求时，其结构为 suggest/insist +that 从句（用 should）：
He suggests that they should sell the flat. I hope they won’t sell the flat.
He still insisted that we should help him.

【Multiple choice questions】
3 John Gilbert was in hospital. He was taken _ c_ hospital last week.

a. has done b. must do c. must be doing d. must have done
a、has done 已经做的 ； b、must do 必须做的 ；c、must be doing
must+ v.(原形)＝have to 不得不；很可能（对现在或者将来的推测）
must +原形, +be doing, +have done 属于推测句型的三种结构
must be doing 对说话的当时的正在进行的行为的推测
He must be sleeping.
He must be making the notes.

【Text】
Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs. Rumbold. Mrs. Rumbold was a large,
unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes were
fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I tried to make conversation.
'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'
'No,' she answered.
'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.
'No,' she answered.
'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.
'No,' she answered.
In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.
'Young man,' she answered, 'if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!’

参考译文
在上星期的一次宴会上, 女主人安排我坐在兰伯尔德夫人的身旁. 兰伯尔德夫人是一位身材高大、表情
严肃的女人, 穿一件紧身的黑衣服. 当我在她身旁坐下来的时候, 她甚至连头都没有抬一下. 她的眼睛盯
着自己的盘子, 不一会儿就忙着吃起来了. 我试图找个话题和她聊聊.
“一出新剧要来‘环球剧场’上演了, “我说, “您去看吗?”
“不, “她回答. “您今年去国外度假吗?” 我又问.
“不, “她回答.
“您就呆在英国吗?” 我问.

“年轻人, “她回答说, “如果你多吃点, 少说点, 我们两个都会吃得好的!”

【课文讲解】
1 、Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs. Rumbold.
dinner 为不可数名词，“at a dinner party”中的“a”并不修饰“dinner”而是 “party”,have dinner 不加
“a”
ask sb. to do sth. 叫某人做某事
next to 与......相邻，挨着（既可表示座位挨着也可以表示地理位置上挨着）
sit next to me 坐我旁边
There’s a field/shop next to our house.

```
2 、Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress.
unsmiling 表示 bad mix，很难与人融合。unsmiling 的反义词为 smiling（微笑的，喜气洋洋的）。有
```

些形容词前面可以加上前缀 un-来表示相反的意义：comfortable（舒服的）/ uncomfortable（不舒服的），true
（真实的）/untrue（不真实的），interesting（有趣的）/ uninteresting（无趣味的，乏味的）。
in 在这里表示“穿着、戴着”：
A young man in a blue dress is inquiring for you.
（inquiring for sb. 要找（某人），求见某人）

【Key structures】
**第** 2 **类条件句（虚拟条件句）**
第 1 类条件句，谈论将有可能发生的事情，并且考虑其将来的真实结果。主句用一般将来时，从句用


一般现在时或其他形式的现在时。
If you help me,I will be gratefull. 如果你帮我, 我会感激你 (正常语气)
If it rains, I will not go. 正常语气(不一定会去)
第 2 类条件句，if 从句谈论想象的情况（假设与现在事实相反），主句则推测想象的结果。 从句使用
一般过去时, 主句使用 would+动词原形。尽管第 2 类条件句使用过去时，却并非指过去的时间，所以，if
之后的过去时用法常被称为“非真实的过去”，整个条件句也被称作非真实条件句。
If you helped me,I would be grateful.
如果你帮了我, 我会感激你(可惜你没有帮我, 我不会感激你)
If it rained,it would not be hot. 如果下雨, 就不会这么热
If you could make him change his mind, you would save him a lot of trouble.
假如你能使他改变主意, 你会使他免了许多麻烦.
如果 if 从句中的动词是 be, 那么应该在第一和第三人称单数名词之后用 were。If I were you 这种说法
经常用于提出建议。
If I were you, I’d accept their offer.
If I were in your position, I would act differently.
假如我处于你的位置, 我会采取不同的作法.
第 2 类条件句有时也可代替第 1 类条件句来描述颇有可能发生的事情，但比第 1 类条件句较为“无把
握”。
If you went by train, you would get there earlier.
If you go by train, you will get there earlier.
第 2 类条件句经常用来描写完全不可能的事情。
If I had longer legs, I’d be able to run faster.

【Text】
'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.
'You needn't be so rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.


I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We had been in the hat shop for half an
hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.
'We mustn't buy things we don't need,' I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.
'You needn't have said that,' my wife answered. 'I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.'
'I find it beautiful,' I said. 'A man can never have too many ties.'
'And a woman can't have too many hats,' she answered.
Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a
lighthouse!

参考译文
“你把那个叫帽子吗?” 我对妻子说.
“你说话没必要这样不客气, “我的妻子边回答边照着镜子.
我坐在一个新式的满是网眼儿的椅子上, 等待着. 我们在这家帽店已经呆了半个小时了, 而我的妻子
仍在镜子面前.
“我们不应该买我们不需要的东西, “我突然发表意见说, 但马上又后悔说了这话.
“你没必要这么说, “我妻子回答说, “我也不必提醒你昨天买的那条糟糕透了的领带.
“ “我觉得它好看, “我说, “男人有多少领带也不会嫌多. “
“女人有多少帽子也不嫌多. “她回答.
10 分钟以后, 我们一道走出了商店. 我妻子戴着一顶像灯塔一样的帽子.

【课文讲解】
1 、Do you call that a hat?
“Do you call that +（冠词）+名词”这个结构可以表达一种轻蔑的含义：
Do you call that a house/a dog? 你把那个叫房子/狗吗？

```
2 、You needn't be so rude about it.
be rude about sth. 对事很粗鲁
be rude to sb. 对人很粗鲁
Don't be rude to me. 别对我这么粗鲁
```
```
3 、I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited.
on the chair 在椅子上
with holes in it 作定语
Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle.
```
```
4 、We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.
名词修饰名词, 一般用单数：bookstore 书店，drugstore 药店,
```
```
5 、I regretted saying it almost at once.
regret doing sth./名词/that 从句 后悔已经做了某事，表示对做过的事感到遗憾
Did he regret his mistake?
```

```
I now regret leaving my country/that I have left my country.
regret to do sth. 表示对现在或将来要做的事感到对不起、遗憾，比 be sorry to do sth.要正式：
We regret to tell you that you are not welcome. 我很遗憾地告诉您，您不受欢迎。
```
6 、 'You needn't have said that,' my wife answered. 'I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought
yesterday.'
needn't have done 原本不必做, 但是做了, 强调过去的动作不必做
You needn't have bought it. 你原本不必买的
You needn’t have come. 你原本不必来的。
needn't do 现在的动作也不必做
You needn’t come. 你不必来。
remind sb. of sth. 提醒某人想起某事

```
7 、'I find it beautiful,' I said.
动词 find 经常用于“动词+宾语+宾语补足语”这种结构：
You’ll find it difficult/easy to make conversation with her.
I find this book very interesting.
```
```
8 、A man can never have too many ties.
can never...too...＝cannot...too... 无论......也不为过
A man can never have too many ties.
再多的领带对一个男人来说也不为过（男人有多少领带也不会嫌多）。
I can never thank you too much. 感激不尽。
Drinking water can never be too clean. 饮用水越干净越好。
A wife can never complain too much. 妻子怎么罗嗦也不为过。
You can’t be too careful in doing your work. 你工作越小心越好。
```
【Key structures】
Must, Have (got) to and Need
情态动词 must（必须，不得不）的否定式 mustn't（不能、不准），must 还可用于表示推测：
① 对现在和将来的推测：must +动词用原形
② 对正在发生的事情的推测：must be doing
③ 对过去的推测：must have done
④ 对过去正在发生的事情的推测：must have been doing
用 must 的一般疑问句可以用 must/have to 或 needn’t 来回答，而不用 mustn’t：
Must I set off now?
Yes, you must / have to.
No, you needn’t.
mustn’t 表示绝对禁止，在说话人看来，根本没选择余地：
You mustn’t use that bicycle. It’s broken.
“不必要”可用 needn’t，don’t have to 来表示：
needn’t = don’t have to


needn’t have done = didn’t have to
You needn’t / don’t have to work such long hours.
英语中的 need 有两种词性，一个是普通动词（需要），一种是情态动词。need 的否定形式对应也有两
种： needn't 不必（情态动词 need 的否定）； don't need 不需要（普通动词 need 的否定）。
need I...?(情态) / do I need...? 实义动词
在实义动词后面再加一个实义动词, 就在后面加 to do
Need I go out? = Do I need to go out? 我需要出去吗?
You needn’t have told me that. I know it is.
情态动词后面不能直接用名词做宾语，实义动词后面可以直接加名词, 故 need 后面如是名词, 则这个
need 为实义动词
例 : He c follow me.
a doesn’t need b needn’t to c didn’t need to d needs
情态动词 need 后接动词原形，但只用于否定和疑问句，肯定句用 must，have to，ought to 或 should。
need 用于疑问句时，问者往往希望得到否定的回答：
Need you leave so soon? 你有必要这么早就走吗？
用 need 的一般疑问句的肯定形式的回答可以用 must/had to，否定形式的回答可以用 needn’t：
Need I type this letter again?
Yes, you must. / No, you needn’t.
Need you have told him about my plans?
Yes, I had to. / No, I needn’t have.
表示必要时，must 的语气比need 要强：
I must go to the dentist this moring.
这种句型可用来表示说话人让对方选择或允许对方可以不做某事的主观意图。它的完成式和过去式分
别为needn’t have，didn’t have to 和 didn’t need to：
I needn’t have gone to the office yesterday.
I didn’t have to / didn’t need to go to the office yesterday.
need doing sth. 需要被做（用主动表达被动含义）
① 这里 need 属于实义动词, 动词 ing 相当于名词来理解
② 有时态和人称变化,否定式为: don’t need doing
③ need doing 表达被动含义, 如: Your shoes need washing. 你的鞋子需(被)洗了
另外 want doing 也是用主动表示被动含义，它们的主语一定是物, 不是人
Your hair needs cuting.
need to be done---主语是人,也可以是物
The child need to be ...

```
对比 mustn't 和 needn't：
You musn’t read it bed. It’s bad for your eyes.
（be bad for... 对......有害）
Smoking is bad for your health. 抽烟有害你的健康
You mustn't make a noise. The children are asleep. 你不应吵闹, 孩子们都睡了.
You needn't drive so quickly. We have plenty of time.
你不必开得那么快, 我们有足够的时间.
=You don't have to(haven't got to) drive so quickly. We have plenty of time.
```

```
You mustn't smoke in a theatre. It is forbidden. 你不应该在剧场里抽烟, 这是不允许的.
You needn't come with us if you don't want to. 如果你不想去, 你不必和我们一道去.
=You don't have to (haven't got to) come with us if you don't want to.
```
【Special Difficulties】Remark,
Observe and Notice
remark 与 observe 都可以表示“说，评论说”，它们比 say 要正式：
‘You’re looking very well!’She remarked/observed.
notice 和 observe 都可以表示“注意到，察觉到”，但有一定区别。notice 指无意中“察觉到”；observe
则可以指有意观察、仔细地看，比 notice 更正式：
He observed me carefully. (He looked at me.) 他仔细地看着我.
Did you notice how she was dressed? 你注意到她的穿戴了吗?
I’ve noticed/observed that he telephones her oftener than before.
我发现/注意到他现在给她打电话比以前次数多了。
I didn’t notice his leaving.
make rude remark / call one's name / say F words (F 指 fuck) 讲粗话，骂人
He made a lot of rude remarks about the hat she was wearing.
fail to do sth. 没有能够
not fail to 表示强烈地肯定
I had changed the furniture round that you can not fail to notict it.

【Multiple choice questions】
3 Do you have to buy this hat? No, I___c___. It isn't necessary.
a. mustn't b. won't c. needn't d. don't need
Do you have to...?
Yes, I do ... / No, I don't ... / No,I don't have to do sth.
mustn't 不准
don't have to 不 必 =needn’t
must＝have to 必须
英文中要么助动词之后所有的东西都省略, 要么省到不定式标志, “don’t need to” 也对
Would you like to do sth?
Yes, I'd like to. / No,I don't / No,I don't need to. (to 不能省略)
Do you want to go to school? Yes,I do. / Yes,I want to.
Would you like to see the menu? Yes, I'd like to. (后接动词)
Would you like some bananas? Yes, I’d like. (后接名词)
Do you need the hat?
No, I don’t need. （不能为“I needn’t”，情态动词不能直接接名词“hat”）

```
7 A man can never have too many ties. It's ___b___.
a. unable b. impossible c. improbable d. incapable
can never ＝can't 不可能
be able/unable to do sth. (unable adj.不能的, 不会的)

【Text】
As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we stopped at a square to have a rest.
After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have
a look at him. As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the
baskets. When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake. It rose out of the basket and began to
follow the movements of the pipe. We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play
jazz and modern pop songs. The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly. It obviously could not tell the
difference between Indian music and jazz!

参考译文
当我们穿过旧德里的市场时走了很长一段路, 我们在一个广场上停下来休息. 过了一会儿, 我们注意到
广场的那一边有一个带着两个大筐的耍蛇人, 于是就走过去看看. 他一见我们, 就拿起了一个长长的上面镶
有硬币的管乐器, 并掀开了一个筐的盖子. 当他开始吹奏一支曲子时, 我们才第一次看到那条蛇. 它从筐里
探出身子, 随着乐器的摆动而扭动. 当耍蛇人突然又吹奏起爵士乐和现代流行乐曲时, 我们感到非常惊奇.
然而那蛇却还是缓慢地 “舞动” 着. 显然, 它分辨不出印度音乐和爵士乐!

```

【Text】
In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American explorer, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew
over the South Pole for the first time. Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many
photographs of the mountains that lay below, they soon ran into serious trouble. At one point, it seemed certain
that their plane would crash. It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet. Byrd at once ordered his
men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet.
Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more
mountains in sight. The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.

参考译文
美国探险家 R.E. 伯德在飞越北极 3 年之后, 于 1929 年第一次飞越了南极. 虽然开始时伯德和他的助
手们拍下了飞机下面连绵群ft的大量照片, 但他们很快就陷入了困境. 在有个地方, 飞机似乎肯定要坠毁
了. 只有在飞至 10,000 英尺的高度时, 它才能飞过这些ft头. 伯德马上命令他的助手们把两个沉重的食物
袋扔掉, 于是飞机可以上升了, 它在离ft头 400 英尺的高度飞越了过去. 伯德这时知道他能够顺利飞抵 300
英里以外的南极了, 因为前面再没有ft了. 飞机可以毫无困难地飞过这片茫茫无际的白色原野!

Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men. They
had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her
handbag. In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their


possession, both men started running through the trees. Mrs. Sterling got so angry that she ran after them. She was
soon out of breath, but she continued to run. When she caught up with them, she saw that they had sat down and
were going through the contents of the bag, so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright that they
dropped the bag and ran away. 'The strap needs mending,' said Mrs. Sterling later, 'but they did not steal anything.'

【Text】
The whole village soon learnt that a large sum of money had been lost. Sam Benton, the local butcher, had
lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post office. Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by
one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him. Three months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his
wallet outside his front door. It had been wrapped up in newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost,
together with a note which said: 'A thief, yes, but only 50 per cent a thief!' Two months later, some more money
was sent to Sam with


another note: 'Only 25 per cent a thief now!' In time, all Sam's money was paid back in this way. The last note
said: 'I am 100 per cent honest now!'

参考译文
整个村子很快知道, 有一大笔钱丢失了. 当地的屠户萨姆.本顿在把存款送往邮局的途中把钱包丢了. 萨
姆确信那钱包一定是被某个村民捡到了, 可是却不见有人来送还给他. 3 个月过去了, 后来在一天早晨, 萨
姆在自己的大门外发现了他的钱包. 钱包是用报纸包着的, 里面有他丢失的钱的一半, 而且还附着一张纸条,
上面写着 : “一个小偷, 是的, 但只是一个 50%的小偷!” 又过了两个月, 又有一些钱送还给了萨姆, 又附了
一张字条 : “这回只是 25%的小偷了!” 很快, 萨姆全部的钱都用同样的方式还了回来. 最后的那张字条上
写道 : “我现在是一个 100%的诚实人了!”

【课文讲解】
1 、A clear conscience 问心无愧

疚）。

the whole world learnt... 全世界都知道......

a large sum of... 一大笔......

3 、Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post office.
while doing 是现在分词短语用于连词之后，作用相当于一个时间状语从句。现在分词这样用的前提是两
个动词的主语是同一个，并且这两个动作通常是同时发生（即这句话一定要是进行时态）。如果主语不 一致
则必须用从句。
这句话完整的应为: while he was taking his savings...

```

【Text】
When a plane from London arrived at Sydney airport, workers began to unload a number of wooden boxes
which contained clothing. No one could account for the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy. It
suddenly occurred to one of the workers to open up the box. He was astonished at what he found. A man was lying
in the box on top of a pile of wooden goods. He was so surprised at being discovered that he did not even try to
run away. After he was arrested, the man admitted hiding in the box before the plane left London. He had had a
long and uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the wooden box for over eighteen hours. The man was
ordered to pay $3,500 for the cost of the trip. The normal price of a ticket is $2,000!

参考译文
当一架来自伦敦的飞机抵达悉尼机场时, 工人们开始卸下装有服装的一批木箱. 其中有只箱子特别重,
可谁也弄不清是怎么回事. 突然一个工人想到打开箱子看看. 看到的情景使吃惊, 箱内有一个人正躺在一堆
毛织品之上. 他由于被人发现而感到非常吃惊, 甚至都没有企图逃跑. 此人被逮捕后, 承认他是在飞机离开
伦敦前躲进箱里的. 他经历了一次漫长而又难受的旅程, 因为他在那木箱里闷了 18 个多小时. 此人被责令
交付旅费 3,500 英镑, 而正常票价是 2,000 英镑!


### 【课文讲解】

```
1 、Expensive and uncomfortable
It is too expensive! 贵得令人不能接受
The book is dear. 这本书有点贵（dear adj.昂贵的, 亲爱的）
```
2 、When a plane from London arrived at Sydney airport, workers began to unload a number of wooden boxes
which contained clothing.
a number of... 许多，若干......
You’ve made a number of mistakes in typing this letter.
unload 的含义为“卸（货）”，它的反义词为 load（装货）。与形容词 uncomfortable，unsmiling 等相似，
有些动词加前缀 un 可以表示做相反的动作。
clothing 服装的总称，不可数名词，在分类时强调衣服这一种类，可以包括鞋、帽等；clothes 一般指衣
服，表示"衣服"的单数名词的复数形式, 表示许多衣服。

3 、 No one could account for the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy.
No one could account for the fact that... 谁也弄不清楚......这样一个事实
No one knows... 没有人知道......
account for = explain= give the explanation 说明原因、作出说明（或解释），但也有区别，account 的解
释必须是令人满意的，而 explain 却只要是一个解释就行
The bad weather in England accounts for Harrison’s decision to leave the country.
How do you account for the battered car?
that 后面的从句为 fact 的同位语从句，说明 fact 的具体内容。
一个句子跟在一个名词后，可以是定语从句，也可以是同位语从句。两者的区别是同位语从句后的 that
是起解释说明的作用，而定语从句是起修饰作用；that 在从句中做主语或宾语成分，则是定语从句，that 在
从句中不能做主语或宾语成分，则是同位语从句
My friend Lucy 同位语
He couldn’t explain the fact that Mary’s wallet was found in his room.

```
4 、It suddenly occurred to one of the workers to open up the box.
sth. occurred to sb. 某人想起某事
open up 打开
When he received the gifts, he opened them up at once.
```
```
5 、He was astonished at what he found.
sb. be astonished at sth. 某事使/让某人吃惊
Sam appears astonished at the news/sound.
what 引导名词性从句作介词 at 的宾语，what = the thing which/that...
```
```
6 、A man was lying in the box on top of a pile of wooden goods.
a pile of 一堆......
piles of snow 一堆堆的雪
on top of 在......之上（与顶端有接触面）
```

at the top of 在......上方（at the top of 之前的词属于其之后的词的范围之内）


7 、He had had a long and uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the wooden box for over eighteen
hours.
have a trip = go on a trip
be confined to 把......限制起来
Last weekend, Tom’s mother confined him to his room.
for 在文中这里强调事实, 而非原因
over = more than

```
8 、The man was ordered to pay $3,500 for the cost of the trip.
pay...for... 为......付钱，为......付出代价
She paid $50 for that dress.
cost of... ......的花费, 费用
the cost of government 政府开支
```

【Text】
A public house which was recently bought by Mr. Ian Thompson is up for sale. Mr.Thompson is going to sell
it because it is haunted. He told me that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise
coming from the bar. The next morning, he found that the doors had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had
been moved. Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning.
He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which the ghost must have drunk the night before. When
I suggested that some villagers must have come in for a free drink, Mr.Thompson shook his head. The villagers
have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.

参考译文
伊恩.汤普森先生最近才买的一个小酒店现在又要卖出去. 汤普森先生之所以想卖它, 是因为那里常闹
鬼. 他告诉我有天夜里他怎么也睡不着, 因为他听到酒吧里传来一阵奇怪的响声. 第二天早上, 他发现酒
吧间的门被椅子堵上了, 家具也被挪动过. 虽然汤普森临睡觉时把灯关了, 但早晨灯却都亮着. 他还说他
发现了 5 只空的威士忌瓶子, 肯定是鬼魂昨天晚上喝的. 当我暗示说一定是村里有些人来喝不花钱的酒时,
汤普森先生摇了摇头. 村里的人已经告诉他, 即使他把小酒店白送人, 他们也不要.

Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer. My dentist had just pulled out one of
my teeth and had told me to rest for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool. He
knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing. He then asked me how my
brother was and whether I liked my new job in London. In answer to these questions I either nodded or made
strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt
very worried, but could not say anything. When the dentist at last removed the cotton wool from my mouth, I was
able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.

【Text】
Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed. For the first time
in his life, he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress. Because the weather was very
hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house. He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night,
a storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below. The
young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man
was miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the mattress. Glancing at the bits of wood and metal
that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house. After he had put


it on the floor, he promptly went to sleep again.

参考译文
德黑兰的一个年轻人由于对睡地板感到厌倦, 于是积蓄多年买了一张真正的床. 他平生第一次自豪地
拥有了一张既有弹簧又带床垫的床. 由于天气很热, 他便把床搬到了他的屋顶上. 头两天晚上, 他睡得非常
好. 但第三天晚上起了风暴. 一阵大风把床从屋顶上刮了下来, 把它摔碎在下面的院子里. 那年轻人直到床
撞到地上才醒了过来. 尽管床摔成了碎片, 但年轻人却奇迹般地没有受伤. 他醒来时, 仍然躺在床垫上. 年轻
人看了一眼周围的碎木片和碎金属片, 伤心地捡起了床垫, 把它拿进了屋. 他把床垫往地板上一放, 很快又
睡着了.

【课文讲解】
1 、Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed.
be tired of 对......感到厌倦，在这句话里省略了现在分词 being，用形容词短语直接做原因状语，
其作用相当于原因状语从句 as he was tired of...。
I always go to bed hungry. （用形容词直接做状语）
Worried about my daughter, Lucy, she went to London to visit Lucy.
I went home. I am tired. => I went home tired
I went home excited.
save up 攒钱，储蓄
I want to get married in one or two years, so I’m trying to save (some money) up.

```
2 、For the first time in his life, he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress.
for the first time in one's life 平生第一次
He became the proud father of a baby. 我自豪的成为一个孩子的父亲了.
```
3 、Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house.
on to（onto） 类似与 in to（into），用于表示动作方向而不用于表示静态的位置，不但有“去”的概念
还有把它放到“on”（上面）的概念。onto/on to 有时可用 on 代替，但表示位置的 on 不可用 onto 代替：
Lift sth. on to the cart.
I put the pen onto/on the table.
The pen is on the table. （不能用 onto/on to）
Mr. Thompson is jumped onto the stage. 汤普森先生跳上了台上。
Mr. Thompson jumped on the stage. 汤普森先生在台上跳了跳。

```
4 、He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up.
for the first two nights 头两天晚上
I study hard for the first three days.
for the last three nights 最后三天晚上
blow up <adv.> 风越刮越大(程度在加深)，（指暴风雨）出现并加剧；刮起
speak up 大声点
```

5 、A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below.
gust 表示“一阵强风，一阵狂风”，既可单独使用，也可用 a gust of wind 形式：
A gust (of wind) blew my hat off.
She set off even though the wind was blowing in gusts.
虽然当时阵阵狂风吹着，她还是出发了。
off = down/away from
below 直接放在被修饰词之后作定语
crashing into the courtyard below 是现在分词短语，作宾语补足语。crash （不及物动词）直接用主动形
式，smash（及物动词）可用被动
一个句子中不能出现两个动词，如果出现了两个动词，要用 and 或 but 连接；或者把其中一个作为非
谓语动词 to do(表目的)，-ed(表被动)，-ing(表主动)。

6 、The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground.
not...until 表示“直到......才”，until 前面没有 not 时，与表示一段时间的“持续动词”连用；有 not
时，常用表示某一时间点的动词（或瞬间动词）连用：
I’ll stay here until Monday. 我要在这儿呆到星期一。
I won’t leave until Monday. 我要到星期一才离开。

```
7 、Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt.
although 尽管；though 虽然，意义差不多，以从句出现
to pieces 粉碎地，成碎片地
The cup was broken to pieces.
```
8 、 Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and
carried it into his house.
glancing 为现在分词，引导的短语相当于一个时间状语从句 after he glanced at...。动词的 ing 形式一定
强调某一个名词之间的主动关系。
glance v. 看一眼，扫视
Joe glanced through the newspaper while talking to me.
乔一边和我聊天，一边浏览报纸。
bits = pieces
lie (lay，lain) 不及物动词，后面一定要加“around”，不能说成“lay him”

【letter writing】
大多数书信都以“dear”开头，后接姓名，“dear”这个词一定要在信纸的左手边顶格。第二行如要退
格是退 5 个字符, 现在西方都是顶格写。

【Key structures】
**复合句的语序**
复合句可用两种方法构成：一是用连词把从句与主句连接起来；二是用分词结构或不定式。
1 、用连词连接的复合句

I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.
I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.
'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'
'I'll tell you where to get off.' answered the conductor.
I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking
round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.
'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we go.'
'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.
'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'
'It doesn't matter,' I said. 'I'll get off here.'
'We're going back now,' said the conductor.
'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus,' I answered.

给平辈的亲属写信，直接称呼名字，不加称谓。


【Summry writing】
1 Where did the writer want to go? Did he know the way or not? What did the conductor promise to do?
(but as)
“but as” 并不是并列短语, 两者连在一起仅仅是巧合
The writer wanted to go to Woodfast Green but as he did not know the way, the conductor promised to tell
him where to get off.
第一句和第二句之间是 “but” 关系, 第二句和第三句之间为 “as” 关系, 所以产生 “but as”

My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but things got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet. He began
his diet a week ago. First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden. The list included
most of the things Hugh loves: butter, potatoes, rice, beer, milk, chocolate; and sweets. Yesterday I paid him a visit.
I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever. He led me into his room and
hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk. It was obvious that he was very embarrassed. When I asked him what
he was doing, he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk. He explained that his diet was so strict that he
had to reward himself occasionally. Then he showed me the contents of the parcel. It contained five large bars of
chocolate and three bags of sweets!

floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room. A short while ago, my sister helped
me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs. She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all
those books on the floor. 'This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen,' she said. She gazed at it for some time then
added, 'You don't need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!'

【Key structures】
**现在完成时，现在完成进行时**
现在完成时：have done，表示已完成的动作
现在完成进行时：have been doing，强调动作在某一段时间内一直在进行，而且动作现在有结果。到现在
为止，该动作可能已不再继续进行，也可能还在继续进行，这要根据上下文来确定。句子中常含有 all+ 表示
时间的词语如 all day，all morning 等或 for 和since。
I have read the book. 书已看完
I have been reading the book. 还没看完, 还要继续
表示持续性的动词，如 learn，lie，live，rain，sleep，stand，可以同 since 或 for 副词短语连用，也可
用于以 how long 开头的疑问句中：
I’ve been working for Exxon for 15 years.
现在完成进行时还可以表示经常重复的动作：
Jim has been phoning Jenny every night for the last week.
与段时间连用可以用现在完成时, 也可以用现在完成进行时, 但跟次数连用的, 一定只能用完成时, 不
能用现在完成进行时
He has rung me up five times since 12 o’clock.

【语法精髓】
1 、You should go to bed. You ___ (watch) TV for 5 hours.
2 、I _____ (write) letters since breakfast.
3 、I _____ (write) 3 letters since breakfast.
4 、Sorry, but Mr.Smith _____ (leave) for Beijing.
5 、I _____ (look) for him everywhere, where can he be?

1 、have been watching/have watched
2 、having been writing
3 、have written
4 、has left
和现在完成进行时连用的, 一定不能是次数；和现在完成进行时连用的动词, 一定不能是短暂动词，
leave 是瞬间动词
5 、have been looking 通过 “where can he be?” 这句话可知人没找到, 还要继续找

【Special Difficulties】
**形容词、相应的副词及其用法：**
许多副词，特别是表示方式的副词，皆由形容词加-ly 构成，如 easy（容易的）/easyly（容易地），beautiful

几个表示程度及观点的副词也都以-ly 结尾：high（高的）/highly（高度地），real（真的）/really（真正的）。
大多数形容词加 “ly” 变为副词 : 如 beautiful－－beautifully，但是不是所有的形容词都可以


加 ly(asleep)；不是所有的副词都一定以 ly 结尾(late)；不是所有的加 ly 的都是副词(lovely)
有些副词虽然由形容词加-ly 构成，但在意义上与其相应的形容并不相同，如 hard（勤奋的，困难的）
/hardly（几乎不），cold（冷的）/coldly（冷淡的），late（迟到的，晚的）/lately（最近，近来），near（近
的，接近的）/nearly（几乎，差不多，差点儿）。
有些副词有两种形式。有的意义相同，如 cheap（廉价的）/cheaply（廉价地），但有的意义不同如 late
（迟，晚）/lately（近来），hard（努力地，猛烈地）/hardly（几乎不）。
late<adj. , adv.> 迟 ； lately adv. 近来(=recently)
hard<adj. , adv.> 努力地(表示程度深), 困难地(=difficult) ；hardly 几乎不
high<adj.>高的 ，〈adv.>高度地 ；highly〈adv.> 高度地 (不能用尺度测量的, 抽象的)
deep<adj. , adv.> 深的； deeply 〈adv.> 深度地 (不能用尺度测量的, 抽象的)
near<adj. , adv.> 在旁边的 ；nearly 〈adv.> 几乎, 将近
有些副词在形式上与形容词相同，如 fast，past，far 等。
大多数方式副词的位置一般在宾语或动词前面，表示时间的副词常位于句尾，有时也可位于句首。程
度副词，如 almost，enough，hardly，nearly，quite，rather，too 等，大部分用在它们所修饰的动词之前。
副词修饰动词(walk quickly), 形容词(very beautiful), 副词词性本身(very much), 还可以修饰句子

```
Quite and Quiet
quite adv. 完全，相当，很
I’m quite ready. 我已全准备好了。
Are you quite certain? 你敢完全肯定吗？
quiet adj. 安静的，平静的，静止的，寂静的
The sea was very quiet this morning. 今天上午上海很平静。

At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California. Since then, they have been trying to find out how
the fire began. Forest fires are often caused by broken glass or by cigarette ends which people carelessly throw
away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were
also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered
the cause. He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power
line. In this way, he was able to solve the mystery. The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had
snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound itself round the
wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.

【Text】
After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops. It was still early when I returned
home. The children were at school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. So I decided to make some
meat pies. In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry.
At exactly that moment, the telephone rang. Nothing could have been more annoying. I picked up the receiver
between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Helen Bates. It took me ten minutes
to persuade her to ring back later. At last I hung up the receiver. What a mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on
the telephone, and on the doorknobs. I had no sooner got back to the kitchen than the doorbell rang loud enough to
wake the dead. This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter!

最近, 找到失踪宝藏的梦想差一点儿变成现实. 一种叫 “探宝器” 的新机器已经发明出来, 并被人们用
来探测地下埋藏的金子. 在靠近海边的一个据说过去海盗常在里面藏金子的岩洞里, 这种机器被派上了用
场. 海盗们过去常把金子埋藏在那个洞里, 可后来却没能取走. 一支用这种新机器装备起来的探宝队进入了
这个岩洞, 希望找到埋藏着的金子. 当这个队的队长正在检查洞口附近的土壤时, 那台机器显示出它的下面
埋有金子. 队员们异常激动, 就地挖了一个两英尺深的坑, 但最后找到的是一枚几乎一钱不值的小金币. 队
员们接着又把整个洞彻底搜寻了一遍, 但除了一只空铁皮箱外什么也没找到. 尽管如此, 很多人仍然相信
“探宝器” 很快就会探出值钱的东西来.

buried in the ground.
一句话中只有一个动词, 如果再出现动词, 可以用 and 并列连接, 也可以变成复合句, 用 when, because

【 **Text** 】
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine called 'The Revealer' has been
invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground. The machine was used in a cave
near the seashore where - - it is said - - pirates used to hide gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and
then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried
treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed
that there was gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small
gold coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find
anything except an empty tin trunk. In spite of this, many people are confident that 'The Revealer' may reveal
something of value fairly soon.


```
n. +called 被称之为......的......（如果用短语修饰其他词, 则把短语放在被修饰词的后边）
the plane called a “Pilatus Porter”
be used to do sth. 被用来......
used to do 过去常常
同位语从句中的引导词只有一个 that，不会用 which
in the ground (更习惯于用 “under the ground” )
```
```
3 、The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates used to hide gold.
it is said 是插入语，当“据说”讲。
where = in which 翻译时译为 “在那儿”，修饰 cave；一个地点状语从句
This is the river where I swim.
```
```
4 、The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.
would 表示过去的习惯性动作, 但此处表示 “used to” 过去常做
fail to do sth. 未能、不能、忘记做某事项 （fail 后面接动词不定式表示否定）
He failed to see the reason why they sent him away.
collect 的含义之一为“（去）取，接”
Don’t fail to collect me before you go to the party.
I’ll collect my post on my way home.
```
5 、Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.
如果几个句子的主语是同一事物, 则可以把几个句子合并为一个句子。保留一个句子做主句, 其他的变
成非谓语动词。非谓语动词采用何种形式, 则根据其与主语的关系, 如果是主动关系, 用-ing, 被动关系, 则
用动词的-ed 形式
主句与其他句子的位置安排要保持句子的平衡, 还要注意动作的连贯
The boy went home. The boy was crying. The boy was beaten.
=Beaten by sb, the boy went home, crying.
arm(ed) with 可以表示“带着、装着、穿着”等
Don’t worry. I’m armed with an umbrella.

I am five years old.
The street is five meters wide.
long/wide/high/deep，人有多高用 “tall”
```
```
7 、In spite of this, many people are confident that 'The Revealer' may reveal something of value
```

fairly soon.
in spite of / though / even if 尽管
something of value
of 表示其所修饰的名词具有某种性质、状况，of 加名词往往让人联想这名词对应的形容词
The news is of great importance to us.
of value＝valuable 有价值的
of small value 价值很小(= almost worthless)
形容词要放在不定代词的后边
something important =something of importance
someone patient =someone of patience

【Summary writing】
1 Is‘The Revealer’a new machine or an old machine?Is it used for detecting buried gold or not?(which)
2 Did a search party use this machine or not? Where did they try to find gold recently?(Using this machine...)
3 Did they examine the cave thoroughly or not? Did they only find a small gold coin?Was it valuable or was it
practically worthless?(Although...which)
4 Do many people believe that the machine may reveal something of value soon or not?(However)

1 、machine 作为先行词, it 指代 machine, 会被which 所取代
2 、Using this machine, a seach party tried to find the gold in came near the seashore.
3 、Although 会引导让步状语从句, which 会引导一个定于从句
Although they examined the came thoroughly ,they only found a small gold coin which was practically

亮的汽车之一是罗尔斯-罗伊斯生产的银鬼汽车, 而最不寻常的一辆则要属只有 3 只轮子的奔驰牌汽车了.

抛了锚, 而有些驾驶员花在汽车底下的时间比坐在汽车里面的时间还长. 然而还是有几辆汽车跑完了全程.
获胜的那辆车达到了时速 40 英里——远远超过任何对手. 它在接近终点时, 冲下了ft坡, 驾驶员费了好大
劲才把车停下来. 这次比赛使每个人都挺开心. 它虽然与现代汽车比赛大不相同, 但激动人心的程度并不亚

A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop. Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally
went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was
dressed. Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily
and decided to punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat,
with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the
same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he
climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She
enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she
had first asked for.

do window shopping (表示在橱窗外面购物)

```
```
2 、Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window.
for a moment 不一定要与现在完成时连用, 也可以是一般现在时, 只要这个动词是延续性动词就可以

```

```
3 、The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed.
dress sb. 给某人穿衣服
Mother is dressing her baby.
I dress myself. 自己给自己穿衣服（反身代词是不能做主语的,故 I am dressed.）

the way 可以直接加定语从句, 不需要引导词

```
6 、Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time.
现在分词短语代替一个分句位于句首时，其否定形式是在它前面加上 not，without 或 never 等否定词。
这些词有时可互换，有时则不可：
Not/Without/Never hesitating for a moment, he ran after the thief.
Not being able to open the door, I asked my neighbour for help.
tell sb. not to do sth. 告诉某人不要做某事
像 eager，glad，pleased，sorry 等描述感觉的形容词作表语时后面往往跟不定式：

【Summary writing】
1 Did the woman in jeans hesitate for a moment or not? Did she enter an expensive shop or not? What did
she ask to see? (Though ... and)
2 What did an assistant tell her? When did the woman return? Was she dressed in a fur coat or not? (On
being told by)
3 What was the assistant eager to do this time?
4 What did she make him bring her? What did the woman finally buy? (After making)

1 、Though the woman in jeans hesitated for a moment,she entered an expensive shop and asked for/to see the
dress in the shop window.
第一步写单句, though 后面要加一个从句, 第一个句子和第二个都做主句并列, 则 though 后面还有第
三个从句, though 后面有从句是第一个和第二个并列, 但还有个主句
2 、On being told by an assistant that the dress was sold,
① The woman returned the following morning dressed in a fur coat.
② When the woman returned ,she was dressed in a fur coat. / the woman returned , when she was dressed in
a fur coat.
by +主动语态中的主语
前后两句的强调点不同, 本句中应强调 “return” , 故后面一句更好, 这属于 tiny mistake(微小的错误),
当然第一句最好, 另外应注意句子的平衡, 也应将 “when” 放后面
4 、After making the assistant bring..., the women finally bought the dress she had......
The woman finally bought what she had first asked for. 也对!

【Letter writing】
在信的开头常的下面两个句型：
What a surprise it was to ...
What a surprise it was to send me flowers.
在 to do sth. 的结构当中，可以在前面表达动作由谁做, 加一个“for sb.”
It is important for me to do sth. （“for” 一定要加在 “to” 的前面）
What a surprise it was for you to send me flowers.
Forgive me for not writing earlier, but ... 我很抱歉我这么久没给你写信
I apologize. / I do apologize. 我真的很抱歉!(do 其强调作用)
You apology is accepted.


【Key structures】
At, In, Off and With
在表示地点和位置时，说话人的个人角度会影响对介词的选择。at 通常用于表示居住地点和某个停留
地点、工作地点等，而 in 表示里面或包围的含义：
I'll see you at the station. 我将到车站送你.
On the way home, we stopped at a small village called Puddleton.
There were a lot of people in the street. 街上有许多人.
Let's go for a walk in the park. 让我们到公园去散散步.
off 常与动词连用，表示位置的变化，即“与......分离”，可译为“脱掉，脱落”（相当于 away from 或
down from 的意思）等，其反义词为 on：
The lid came off easily. 这个盖子很容易掉.
The pencil rolled off the table. 铅笔滚到桌子下面去了.
描写人时，in 通常用于表示穿着，后面加衣服或颜色，with 则表示身上的某个具体特征或随身带着、
拿着什么：
He looks handsome in that uniform.
That man with long hair is supposed to be a poet. 那个留着长发的男人应该是个诗人.
The police are looking for a man with a scar on his face.
The woman with the brown handbag and long umbrella is a famous novelist.
A child came along with a brown dog.

【Special Difficulties】
Make and Let
make 和let 后面都跟不带 to 的不定式，但意义上和用法上有区别：
make+名词/代词+不带 to 的不定式，表示“迫使，致使”：
She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window.
What made him change his mind?
That beard makes you look much older than you really are.
在被动语态中含有上述意义的 make 后面必须带 to：
He was made to work fourteen hours a day.
He was made to change his mind.
let 用于祈使句，建议包括说话者在内的人采取某一行动：
Let’s not waste any more time.
其否定形式除“Let’s not...”外也可以用“Don’t let’s...”：
Don’t let’s waste any more time.
let+名词/代词+不带 to 的不定式，表示“允许”：
Don't let him persuade you. 不要让他把你说服了.
Let me try. 让我试一拭.
Don't let the children touch anything in this room please.
如果宾语是 us，则不能缩写成 let’s：
Please let us have more time, will you?
let 后面可以跟一个被动的、不带 to 的不定式：
He let it be known that the house was his.


```
但 let 一般不用于被动意义来表示“被允许”，这时可用 allow。
We were not allowed to speak.
```
【Multiple choice questions】
5 After ___b___out the rude assistant she asked for the same dress.
a. she was seeking b. she had sought c. sought d. when she sought
after, before 后面一定要加两种概念：句子或 V+ing，after 后面不能接进行时态

9 She returned the following day. She returned the day ___c___.

books
after =later 可以放在结尾, 副词表达式
three days later / three days after

【Text】
The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree'. Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper,
the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased. The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it is
only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation. It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad
luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims.
The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that the tree cut
down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been
coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said, the tourists have been picking
leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!

据说弗林利这个小村里有一棵 “该诅咒的树”. 就因为报上提到过这棵树, 所以现在来弗林利参观的人
越来越多. 该树是 50 年前栽在教堂附近的, 但只是近几年才得到了一个坏名声. 据说, 谁要是触摸了这棵
树, 谁就会交上恶运; 如果谁摘了一片树叶, 谁就会死去. 很多村民相信此树已经害了不少人. 人们曾请求教
区的牧师叫人把树砍掉, 但他直到现在也没有同意. 他指出, 由于人们从全国各地纷纷前来参观这棵树, 它
成了一个有用的财源. 尽管有上述种种说法, 但游客们还是照常摘树叶和把他们的名字刻在树干上. 然而到

【Text】
Our dog, Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and dark. Every time he wanted to come into the garden he
would bark until someone opened the gate. As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks
training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate.
However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. This time he was
barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens
the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then he sits and barks until
someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my husband
removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.

克斯很快成了开门的专家. 然而上星期我正要出去买东西时, 发现它正呆在花园里边靠门的地方. 这次它叫
着让人把它放出去!从那以后, 它养成了另外一种坏习惯. 它从外面把门一打开, 就走进花园, 等着门自动关
上. 这之后他就坐下汪汪叫起来, 直到有人来把它放出去. 出去之后, 它又马上把自己放进来, 接着再开始叫.

连词 so that，in order that 可以引导目的状语从句。目的状语从句必须具备一个特征, 在动词前面一定
要出现情态动词，当主句用一般现在时、现在完成时或一般将来时的时候，so that 和 in order that 后面可以
跟 may，can 或 will；当主句用一般过去时、过去进行时或过去完成时的时候，so that 和 in order that 后面
可以跟 should，could，might 或 would。
I’ve arrived early so that/ in order that I may/ can /will get the tickets.
I arrivd early so that/in order that I might not miss anything.
当前后主语不一致时，不定式前面加 for +名词/代词比 that 结构更简洁，不定式的逻辑主语 for sb. to do

sth. (^)

【Text】
At a village fair, I decided to visit a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky. I went into her tent and she told
me to sit down. After I had given her some money, she looked into a crystal ball and said: 'A relation of yours is
coming to see you. She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days. The moment you leave this
tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you know well will rush towards you. She will speak to you and then
she will lead you away from this place. That is all.'
As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me. 'Where
have you been hiding?' she asked impatiently. 'Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the
station to meet her. We are late already.' As she walked away, I followed her out of the fair.

参考译文
在一个乡村集市上，我决定去拜访一位称作别林斯夫人的算命人。我走进她的帐篷，她叫我坐下。我给了
她一些钱后，她便查看着一个水晶球说道：“您的一个亲戚就要来看您了。她将于今天傍晚到达，并准备住
上几天。您一走出这个帐篷，就会大吃一惊。一位您很熟悉的女人将向您冲来。她会对您说点什么， 然后带您
离开这个地方。就是这些。”
我一走出帐篷，就把别林斯基夫人给算卦的事忘得一干二净了，因为我的妻子正匆匆向我跑来。“你躲到哪
儿去了？”她不耐烦地问，“再有不到一个小时你姐姐就要到这儿了，我们得去车站接她。现在就已经晚
了。”当她走开时，我也跟着她出了集市。

【课文讲解】


```
1 、A relation of yours is coming to see you.
a relation of yours 您的一个亲戚（双重所有格）
句中的现在进行时并不表示目前正在进行的动作，而表示将要发生的事情。
```
2 、The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise.
the moment = as soon as 一......就......（在这个连词引导的时间状语从句中要用一般现在时来表示
将来时）

```
3 、That is all.
在口语中表示“完了，就这些，事情就是这样”。
He borrowed some money from me. That’s all. 他向我借了些钱，仅此而已。
```
```
4 、As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me.
这句话中的 all 是代词，表示“一切，全部，所有的事”，它作主语时被视为单数：
All I can remember is her name.
hurry towards sb. 向某人匆匆走去
```
```
5 、Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her.
must be 表示用现在时态指将来的状况，这句话也可变成：
We must go to the station to meet her.
```
【Key structures】
**表示将要发Th的事情**
在英语中，现在进行时也可用来表示为将来安排好的活动和事件。这种用法通常需要一个表示时间的 状
语（往往是不久的将来）。arrive，come，go，leave 等动词的进行式经常有这种用法，表示行程安排有关的
“将到达，将离去”等意思：
He’s arriving this evening.
We’re spending next winter in Australia.
He’s meeting the vicar in two days’ time.
当时间状语从句表示将来时，在 after，as soon as，before，by the time，the moment，till，until 和 when
等后面通常不用一般将来时而用一般现在时；不用将来完成时而用现在完成时。这两种现在时态在时间连 词
后面常常可以互换：
The Thompsons will move to a new flat when their baby is/ has been born.
I’ll make it before he comes.
在第 1 类条件句中，if 之后通常用一般现在时表示将来可能发生的事：
If he gets the job, he’ll be going abroad.
I’ll give her a meal if she’s hungry.

【Special Difficulties】
**由名词** + **名词构成的复合名词**
第一个名词通常起形容词（或修饰语）的作用，而且一般都用单数。这类复合名词可以代替 of 结构， 如
a car key（汽车钥匙），a chair leg（椅子腿）；也可以理解为第一个名词指地点，第二个词指该地点中的东西，
如 a village pub（乡村酒吧），a world record（世界纪录），a kitchen sink（厨房洗涤槽）；也可以表示


时间，如 a Christams card（圣诞卡），an evening dress（晚礼服），afternoon tea（下午茶）；也可以表示分类，
如 a horror film（恐怖电影），a flower shop（花店），a taxi-driver（出租车司机）；也可以表示材料，如 a fur
coat（裘皮大衣），a gold watch（金表），cigarette ends（香烟头）。

【Text】
Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control. A short
time before, great trees had covered the countryside for miles around. Now, smoke still rose up from the warm
ground over the desolate hills. Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with
destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well. When the
fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would
grow quickly. The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes. The planes had been
planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already
taken root. In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries patches of green had begun to
appear in the blackened soil.

参考译文
消防队员们同那场森林大火搏斗了将近 3 个星期才最后把火势控制住. 就在不久之前, 参天大树还覆
盖着方圆数英里的土地. 而现在, 发热的地面上仍然升腾着烟雾, 弥漫在荒凉的ft丘上. 冬季即将来临, 这些
ft丘对周围的村庄具有毁灭性的威胁, 因为大雨不仅会冲走土壤, 而且还会引起严重的水灾. 在大火最后被
扑灭后, 森林管理当局订购了好几吨一种生长迅速的特殊类型的草籽. 飞机把这种草籽大量地撒播在地上.
飞机撒播近一个月后, 开始下起雨来. 然而到那时, 很多地方的草已经生了根. 一片片的绿草开始出现在这
片烧焦的土地上, 代替了多少世纪以来一直生长在那里的参天大树.

【课文讲解】

【Text】
Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at parties. Everybody admires him for his
great sense of humour -- everybody, that is, except his six-year-old daughter, Jenny. Recently, one of Jeremy's
closest friends asked him to make a speech at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves. He
prepared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny. He had included a large number of funny
stories in the speech and, of course, it was a


great success. As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a little disappointed
by this but he did as his daughter asked. On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his
surprise, she said she hadn't. Jeremy asked her why this was so and she told him that she did not like to see so
many people laughing at him!

杰里米·汉普登交际甚广, 是各种聚会上深受大家欢迎的人. 人人都钦佩他那绝妙的幽默感——人人,
就是说, 除他 6 岁的女儿珍妮之外的每一个人. 最近, 杰里米的一个最亲密的朋友请他在一个婚礼上祝词.
这正是杰里米喜欢做的事情. 他认真准备了讲稿, 带着珍妮一道去参加了婚礼. 他的祝词里面加进了大量逗
人的故事, 自然大获成功. 他刚一讲完, 珍妮就对他说她要回家. 这不免使杰里米有点扫兴, 但他还是按照女
儿的要求做了. 在回家的路上, 他问珍妮是否喜欢他的祝词. 使他吃惊的是, 她说她不喜欢. 杰里米问她为何
不喜欢, 她说她不愿意看到那么多的人嘲笑他!

【Text】
In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile
tunnel under the English Channel. He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the
Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall
chimneys were built above sea level. In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He
suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train
entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at
the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost another
100 years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on March 7,1994, finally connecting Britain to the
European continent.


### 参考译文

1858 年, 一位名叫埃梅·托梅·德·干蒙的法国工程师带着建造一条长 21 英里、穿越英吉利海峡的隧
道计划到了英国. 他说, 可以在隧道中央建造一座平台, 这座平台将用作码头和火车站. 如果再建些伸出
海面的高大的烟囱状通风管, 隧道就具备了良好的通风条件. 1860 年, 一位名叫威廉·洛的英国人提出了一
项更好的计划. 他提议建一条双轨隧道, 这样就解决了通风问题. 因为如果有一列火车开进隧道, 它就把
新鲜空气随之抽进了隧道. 42 年以后, 隧道实际已经开始建了. 如果不是因为那时英国人害怕入侵, 隧道早
已建成了. 世界不得不再等将近 100 年才看到海峡隧道竣工. 它于 1994 年 3 月 7 日正式开通, 将英国与欧
洲大陆连到了一起.

【课文讲解】
1 、In 1858 , a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile
tunnel under the English Channel.

```
4 、He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.
suggest
① vt. 暗示，用法与其他的词相同
② vt. 建议，用虚拟语气，后接动词是要用-ing 形式，后接 that 从句采用一种固定的用法“should+
动词原形”（should 可省略）
I suggested (that) he (should) go home. (that, should 都可省略)
He suggested that I should go with him. 他建议我一定要跟他去.
insist 作“坚持”讲时用法同 suggest
He insisted that I should stay to lunch. 他坚持要我留下来吃晚饭.

5 、 This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air
behind it.
draw in 吸进，如用bring 没有 draw in 形象、贴切

6 、If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed.
虚拟语气(非真实条件句)中，与现在事实相反，从句用一般过去时；与过去事实相反，从句用过去完成
时，此时主句格式为 would have done，would/could/should 都可以
情态动词加 have done 表示对过去的推测，如 must have done，can't have done 等


```
7 、The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.

【Text】
Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a children's hospital.
Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off down the
main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo. He should have known that the police would never
allow this sort of thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as
Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen
had to push very hard to get him off the main street. The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused.
'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him.
Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'

意马上就走, 但江伯却拒绝移动. 15 个警察不得不用很大的力气把它推离主要街道. 警察虽然吃了苦头, 但

【Text】
In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island, a remote place in the South Pacific, a long way west of
Samoa. The plane wasn't too badly damaged, but over the years, the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained
undisturbed. Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash,


the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. By this time, a Lancaster bomber in
reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing. The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in
parts back to France. Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored. It has four Rolls-Royce
Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt. Imagine their surprise and delight when
they broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition.
A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax!

参考译文
1963 年, 一架兰开斯特轰炸机在瓦立斯岛坠毁. 那是南太平洋中一个很偏僻的小岛, 位于萨摩亚群岛以
西, 距离群岛还有很长一段距离. 飞机损坏的程度并不严重, 但是, 多年来这起飞机失事已被遗忘, 飞机残骸
也 没受到破坏. 于是, 到了 1989 年, 飞机失事 26 年后, 在对小岛的一次航空勘查中那架飞机被意外地发
现了. 到了那个时候, 状况良好的兰开斯特轰炸机实属罕见, 值得抢救. 法国政府让人把飞机包装起来, 一部
分一部分 地搬回法国. 一群热心人计划修复这架飞机. 该飞机装配有 4 台罗尔斯-罗伊斯的默林发动机, 但
是他们只需要修复其中的 3 台. 想一想他们所感受到的惊奇和兴奋——当他们拆开包装箱时, 他们发现第
4 台发动机就像蜂蜜一样甜——发动机完好无损. 一群蜜蜂把发动机当作了蜂房, 发动机在蜂蜡中被完整
地保存了下来.

【Text】
Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all
parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named
Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he
managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed
that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed
to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later. This
time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures.
Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man
alive.

波兰科学家哈罗恩·塔捷耶夫花了毕生的精力来研究世界各地的活火ft和深洞. 1948 年他去了刚果的
基伍湖, 对一座后来被他命名为基图罗的新火ft进行观察. 当火ft正在猛烈地喷发时, 塔捷耶夫有办法把帐
篷搭在离它非常近的地方. 尽管他设法拍了一些十分精彩的照片, 但他却不能在火ft附近停留太长的时间.
他发现有一股岩浆正向他流过来, 眼看就要将他团团围住, 但塔捷耶夫还是设法及时逃离了. 他等到火ft平
静下来, 两天以后又返回去. 这次他设法爬进了基图罗火ft口, 以便能拍摄照片和测试温度. 塔捷耶夫经常
冒这样的生命危险. 他能告诉我们的有关活火ft的情况比任何在世的人都要多.

busy doing anything, are you?'

【Key structure】
**动名词的用法**
有些动词后可以用动名词作宾语，但不能用不定式。这些动词包括 avoid，admit，deny，fancy，finish，
enjoy，mind（在乎，在意），suggest，stand（容忍）等。
有些结构通常要接动名词，如 busy，worth，it is no/little use，bored with，interested in，insist on，
prevent...from 等：
I was looking forward to reading those books.
Well, you can’t read them, so it’s no use thinking about them.
动名词可以有自己的逻辑主语（即动作执行者，而不是句子的主语）：
Please excuse his not writing to you.
Do you mind my smoking?
come 和go 之后可以跟与户外活动相关的动名词（climbing，driving，fishing，riding，shopping，walking
等），表示建议、邀请或叙事。
There’s no point in my coming climbing with you.
我和你们去爬ft毫无意义。 （there’s no point in =it is no use）
感知动词（hear，see，fell，watch 等）后面既可以跟宾语加分词结构，也可以跟宾语加不带 to 的不定式。
现在分词往往强调动作正在发生，用于叙述中时使人身临其境；不定式则可以表示动作发生了或过程 结束了。
有时它们之间的区别不大，可以互相替换使用。

【语法精粹】
动名词复合结构：由名词所有格或物主代词与动名词构成
动名词复合结构多作主语或宾语, 作主语时必须是所有格(名词所有格, 形容词性物主代词), 但作宾语
时可以用所有格, 也可用普通格(人称代词宾格)
His leaving is a great loss. 他的离去是一个很大的损失
Mother dislikes my(me) working late. 妈妈不喜欢我工作很迟
Mother dislikes my sleeping late.
John's having seen her did not make her worried.
约翰已经见到她的事实, 没有让她感到担心
后面可以接动词-ing 的词：介词；某些动词，如 avoid, enjoy, finish, It is no use, prevent sb from, fancy,
imagine, escape, risk, allow，deny, appreciate, complete, delay, mind, practice, resent, risk, suggest, permit...
insist on doing, persist in doing, persevere in doing, give up doing
某些词加逻辑主语是，要用不定式作宾语，如：


```
allow+doing sth.(动名词作宾语) ；allow sb. to do sth.(不定式作宾语)
advise sb. to do sth. ；advise doing sth.
这类动词常见如：advise，allow，permit，recommend, etc.

I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time. I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had
done so successfully. After having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence. Sure that I
had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test. The examiner must have been pleased with my performance,
for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in
front of you. As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.' I continued driving and after some
time, the examiner tapped loudly, Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react. I
suddenly pressed the brake pedal and we were both thrown forward. The examiner looked at me sadly. 'Mr.
Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'you have just killed that child!'

一敲车窗，你必须把车停在 5 英尺之内。”我继续往前开着。过了一会儿，主考人砰砰地敲了起来。虽然声音
听得很清楚，但我过了好一会儿才作出反应。我突然用力踩紧刹车踏板，结果我俩的身体都向前冲去。主考人
伤心地看着我。“埃姆斯先生，”他以悲伤的声调说，“你刚刚把那个小孩压死了！”

【Key structures】
**被动语态**
被动语态可以用于“介词+动名词”结构中，在英语中是很正式的用法，一般不用于口语。“介词（after，
before，on）+动名词”这个结构通常相当于一个时间状语从句。如果两个动作中有一个在另一个开始之前 已
经完成，则可以用“after +动名词的完成式”表示第一个动作；如果只表示先后顺序，则可用“after/before
+动名词”结构；“on +动名词”通常表示两个动作几乎同时发生：
The man called the police after being robbed.
He killed a child before being arrested.
On/After being told that her mother was seriously ill, she hurried back to England.
被动语态用于 want 后面的不定式中时，to be 可以省略，want 后跟被动语态时往往表示希望别人完成
所说的动作：
I want the luggage fetched from the hotel this afternoon.
被动语态还可用于过去进行时，以强调动作的持续性：
I was being asked about the film all day yesterday.

【Text】
During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring. The crowd began to shout, but the
drunk was unaware of the danger. The bull was busy with the matador at the time, but it suddenly caught sight of
the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap. Apparently sensitive to criticism, the bull forgot
all about the matador and charged at the drunk. The crowd suddenly grew quiet. The drunk, however, seemed
quite sure of himself. When the bull got close to him, he clumsily stepped aside to let it pass. The crowd broke
into cheers and the drunk bowed. By this time, however, three men had come into the ring and they quickly
dragged the drunk to safety. Even the bull seemed to feel sorry for him, for it looked on sympathetically until the
drunk was out of the way before once more turning its attention to the matador.

当公牛逼近他时，他踉跄地住旁边一闪，牛扑空了。观众欢呼起来，醉汉向人们鞠躬致谢。然而， 此时已有

Greenwich n. 格林尼治
observatory n. 天文台

microphone n. 扩音器，麦克风

【Text】
When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard
all over the world on the B.B.C. If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great clock
would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the
making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense size, but is
extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock checked twice a day. On the
B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones are connected to the clock tower.
Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time. A painter who had been working
on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!

参考译文
当你游览伦敦时，首先看到的东西之一就是“大本”钟，即那座从英国广播公司的广播中全世界都可
以听到它的声音的著名大钟。如果不是国会大厦在 1834 年被焚毁的话，这座大钟永远也不会建造。“大本” 钟
得名于本杰明.霍尔爵士，因为当建造新的国会大厦时，他负责建造大钟。此钟不仅外型巨大，而且走时 也非
常准确。格林尼治天文台的官员们每天两次派人矫正此钟。当大钟打点的时候，你可以从英国广播公 司的广
播中听到，因为钟塔上接了麦克风。“大本”钟很多出差错。然而有一次，它却把时间报错。在钟 塔上干活
的一位油漆工把一只油漆桶挂在了一根指针上，把钟弄慢了！

The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell, was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour. He set
up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird, the car he was driving, had
been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2,500-horsepower engine. Although Campbell
reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour, he had great difficulty in controlling the car because a tyre burst
during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299
miles per hour. However, a few days later, he was told that a mistake had been made. His average speed had been
301 miles per hour. Since that time, racing drivers have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour. Following in his
father's footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolm's son, Donald, also set up a world record. Like his father, he was
driving a car called Bluebird.

【Text】
Children who play truant from school are unimaginative. A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema
seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get. They have all been put to shame by a boy
who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles. He hitchhiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to
find somewhere to sleep. When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the meantime,
travelled to Calais. No one noticed the boy as he crept off. From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry. The driver
gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city. The next car the boy stopped did not
take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border. There he
was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities. He has surely set up a record for
the thousands of children who dream of evading school.

参考译文
逃学的孩子们都缺乏想像力。他们通常能够做到的，至多也就是安静地钓上一天鱼，或在电影院里坐 上
8 个小时，一遍遍地看同一部电影。而有那么一个小男孩，他在逃学期间旅行了 1,600 英里，从而使上述
所有逃学的孩子们都相形见绌了。他搭便车到了多佛，天快黑时钻进了一条船，想找个地方睡觉。第二 天早
上他醒来时，发现船在这段时间已经到了加。当男孩从船里爬出来时，谁也没有发现他。从那里他又 搭上卡
车到了巴黎。司机给了他几块饼干和一杯咖啡，就把他丢在了城外。男孩截住的下一辆车，没有像 他希望的
那样把他带到巴黎市中心，而是把他带到了法国和西班牙边界上的佩皮尼昂。他在那儿被一个警 察抓住了，
之后被当局送回了英国。他无疑为成千上万梦想逃避上学的孩子们创造了一项纪录。

【Key structures】
**简单句、并列句和复合句**
简单句是英语中最小的句子单位，一般有一个限定动词，它有一个主语和一个谓语，但可以用连词 and
将两个或两个以上的动词合并为一个简单句。根据动词后所使用的不同成分，简单句可有 5 种基本句型：
① 主语 +动词
② 主语 +动词 +主语补足语：
③ 主语 +动词 +直接宾语：
④ 主语 +动词 +间接宾语+直接宾语
⑤ 主语 +动词 +宾语 +宾语补足语
将几个简单句连接起来构成并列句。在并列句中不存在单独的主句和从属于它的从句；各小句根据上
下文的要求按逻辑次序排列，但各小句都同等重要并独立存在。我们常常把并列句中的各小句看成是并列 主
句。可采用下列任何一种方式构成并列句：
① 用分号
We fished all day; we didn’t catch a thing.
② 用分号，后面跟一个连接副词(短语)，如 however、above all、in addition、as far as 等
We fished all day; however, we didn’t catch a thing.
③ 用并列连词，如 and、but、so、yet 等，前面常加逗号：
We fished all day, but (we) didn’t catch a thing.
复合句的构成方法可以是把简单句连接在一起，但复合句的各个组成部分并非同等重要(此点与并列句
不同)，其中总有一个独立小句(或称“主句”)和一个或一个以上的从属小句(或称“从句”)；主句往往可
以独立存在。复合句的构成方法：
① 用连词将从句与主句连接起来：
If you’re not good at figures, it is pointless to apply for job in a bank.
如果你不擅于计算，向银行求职就毫无意义。
② 用动词不定式或分词结构。它们是非限定性动词，是短语而不是从句，但它们构成复合句(而非简单
句)的一部分。 之所以如此是因为它们可以用从句的形式表现出来。
To get into a university you have to pass a number of examinations.
从句可分为：名词性从句；关系/形容词从句；副词从句。
Holiday resorts which are very crowded are not very pleasant.
那些拥挤的度假场所令人感到不很愉快。
Howerver hard I try, I can’t remember people’s names.

【Multiple choice questions】
10 They have been put to shame by a boy. They should feel ___a_.
(a) ashamed (b) shy (c) shyness (d) shameful
feel（半联系动词）+ 形容词
shyness n. 害羞
shy adj. 害羞（指人的一种性格）
shame v. 羞愧（跟人遇到某件事情当时的感觉有关系）
shameful adj. 令人羞愧 ；ashamed adj. 感到羞愧

【Text】
An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off. Dressed in dark
glasses and old clothes, they had taken special precautions so that no one should recognize them. But as they soon
discovered, disguises can sometimes be too perfect.
'This is a wonderful place for a picnic,' said Gloria Gleam.
'It couldn't be better, Gloria,' Brinksley Meers agreed. 'No newspaper men, no film fans! Why don't we come
more often?'
Meanwhile, two other actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves, had carried two large food baskets to a
shady spot under some trees. When they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared. He looked
very angry. 'Now you get out of here, all of you!' he shouted. 'I'm sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says "No
Camping" -- in case you can't read!'
'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, 'don't be too hard on us. I'm Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.'
'Oh, is it?' said the sheriff with a sneer. 'Well, I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam. Now
you get out of here fast!'

参考译文
一辆古旧的汽车停在一条干涸的河床边，一群著名男女演员下了车。他们戴着墨镜，穿着旧衣裳，特
别小心以防别人认出他们。但他们很快就发觉，化装的效果有时过分完美了。
“在这个地方野餐简直太妙了，”格格利亚.格利姆说。
“是再好不过的了，格格利亚。”布林克斯利.米尔斯表示同意，“没有记者，没有影迷！我们为什么不经
常来这里呢？”
“此时，另外两位演员，罗克沃尔.斯林格和默林.格里夫斯，已经把两个大食品篮子提到了一片树荫下。当他
们都已安排舒适时，一个陌生人出现了。他看上去非常气愤。“你们都从这里走开，全都走开！”他大叫着，
“我是这里的司法长官。你们看到那个布告牌了吗？上面写着‘禁止野营’－－除非你们不识字！”
“好了，好了，司法官，”罗克沃尔说，“别使我们难堪。我是罗克沃尔.斯林格，这位是默林.格里夫斯。”
“噢，是吗？”那位司法长官冷笑一声说道，“好，我就是布林克斯利.米尔斯。我还有一个名字叫格
格利亚.格利姆。现在你们赶快滚吧！”


### 【课文讲解】

台。
She has been in the limelight since she became an actress.
Although he is a government official, he tries to keep out of the limelight.

```
2 、An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off.
river bed 指河床，名词 river 作形容词用，类似的还有 flower bed（花坛）
party 作量词用时表示“一行，一伙，一群”等，如 a party of tourists/boys（一群旅游者/男孩）等。
```
```

Who is monitor? 谁是班长（官衔）
I am a teacher. teacher 不是官衔，加不定冠词

真正的公告牌上，这些标语往往全部用大写字母，不加标点，如 NO SMOKING 等。

【Text】
When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago, it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was
killed. The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt. It was the middle of winter.
Snow lay thick on the ground. The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away. When it grew dark, she
turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find. During
the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the
case herself, but it was too small. Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she
could send a signal. Then she had an idea. She stamped out the letters 'SOS' in the snow. Fortunately, a pilot saw
the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene
to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.

【Text】
The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an operation. The mummy is that of
Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken
of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do
this was to operate. The operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard
resin which covered the skin. The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They also
found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the god Duamutef. This god which
has the head of


a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died. They feared
that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy
successfully survived the operation.

死于公元前 800 年的一位埃及妇女的木乃伊刚刚接受了一次手术。这是曾在底比斯神殿里当过歌手的赛
潘姆特的木乃伊。由于在给这个木乃伊拍摄的 X 光片子上有点奇怪的斑点，所以，医生们一直试图搞清这位
妇女是否死于一种罕见的疾病。搞清的唯一办法就是手术。手术持续了 4 个多小时，非常难做，因为皮肤上
覆盖着一层硬硬的树脂。医生们从木乃伊身上取下一个切片，送去化验。他们还发现了 X 光片所没有显示的
东西：一个蜡制的杜瓦木特夫神小塑像。这种牛头人身的神像通常被放在木乃伊体内。医生们至 今还未确定

乃伊成功地经受了这次手术。

【Text】
After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I
smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last


cigarette. For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered terribly. I had all the
usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite. My friends kept on
offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of
sweets from my pocket. After seven days of this I went to a party. Everybody around me was smoking and I felt
extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear.
I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal
once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. He himself has
done it lots of times!

读完一篇题为《吸烟与健康》的文章之后，我点上了一枝香烟，来镇定一下自己紧张的神经。我聚精
会神而又愉快地吸着这枝烟。因为我确信这是我最后一枝烟了。整整一个星期我根本没有吸烟。在此期间， 我妻
子吃尽了苦头。我具备了戒烟者通常表现出来的所有症状：脾气暴躁和食欲旺盛。我的朋友们不断地 向我递
香烟和雪茄。每当我从口袋里掏出一包糖果时，他们都毫不掩饰地表现出他们对此感到非常好笑。 这样过了
7 天以后，我去参加一次聚会。我周围的每个人都在吸烟，我感到非常不自在。当我的老朋友布赖恩极力劝
我接受一枝香烟时，我再也忍不住了。我内疚地接过一枝点上，心满意足地抽起来。一切又都 恢复了正常，
为此我妻子十分高兴。不管怎么说，正如布赖恩指出的那样，戒烟是世界上最容易的事情， 他自己就已戒
了很多次了！

experience. I am used to traveling by air and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened. After taking off, we
were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to
the airport. While we were waiting to land, a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly
as soon as it had touched down. Everybody on board was worried and we were curious to find out what had
happened. Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board. The police had been told that a bomb
had been planted on the plane. After we had landed, the plane was searched thoroughly. Fortunately, nothing was
found and five hours later we were able to take off again.

Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteenth century was the Crystal Palace, which was built in
Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world,
for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many
countries came to see it. A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world. There
was also a great deal of machinery on display. The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's
steam hammer. Though in those days, traveling was not as easy as it is today, steam boats carried thousands of
visitors across the Channel from Europe. On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train.
There were six million visitors in all, and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges.
Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world
until it was burnt down in 1936.

参考译文
19 世纪最不寻常的建筑也许要数水晶宫了，它是为 1851 年的“世界博览会”而建在海德公园的。这
座水晶宫不同于世界上所有的其他建筑，因为它是用钢和玻璃建成的。它是有史以来最高大的建筑物之一， 因
此，人们从各个国家纷纷前来参观。大量的商品从世界各地运送到了博览会，参展的还有很多机器，其 中最
奇妙的是内史密斯的蒸汽锤。尽管在当时旅行不像现在这么容易，但汽船还是把成千上万的参观者从 欧洲大
陆送过了英吉利海峡。一到英国，火车就把他们送到了水晶宫。参观的人数总共是 600 万。博览会的赢利
用来建造博物馆和高等学校。后来，“水晶宫”被移到了伦敦南部。在 1936 年被焚毁之前，它一直是世界上
最著名的建筑物之一。

【Text】
Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea. Though people have often laughed at
stories told by seamen, it is now known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply
strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some
time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar. A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea
by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line. Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every
effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet
long. It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail. The fish, which has since
been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish. Such creatures have rarely
been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

却极少能被捕到。然而不久前，在马达加斯加附近的海里却捕到了一条奇怪的鱼。一条小渔船被一 条咬住钩
的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。那位渔民意识到这根本不是一条普通的鱼，于是千方 百计不让它
受到丝毫伤害。当终于把它弄上岸后，人们发现它身长超过了 13 英尺。它长着一个像马一样的头，有着
大的蓝眼睛和闪闪发光的银色皮肤，还有一条鲜红色的尾巴。此鱼叫桨鱼，被送进了博物馆， 现正接受一位

The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections. He is now retiring
from political life and has gone abroad. My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane's
Radical Progressive Party. After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house. When he asked
if Mr. Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone
abroad. On the following day, Patrick went to the house again. The same policeman was just walking slowly past
the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question. Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him
the same answer. The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question. This
time, the policeman lost his temper. 'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday,' he shouted, 'Mr. Lane was
defeated in the elections. He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!"
'I know,' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'

buoy, but it continued to move very quickly across the water. Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore,
when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle. It now came straight towards them at

on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return. They had just had enough time to

Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours. If they are not brought to the surface soon they may
lose their lives. However, rescue operations are proving difficult. If explosives are used, vibrations will cause the
roof of the mine to collapse. Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine. They
intend to bring the men up in a special capsule. If there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil, they
would have completed the job in a few hours. As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have
a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two hours ago, has enabled the
men to keep in touch with their closest relatives. Though they are running out of food and drink, the men are
cheerful and confident that they will get out soon. They have been told that rescue operations are progressing
smoothly. If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock, they would lose heart.

6 个人被困在矿井里已有 17 个小时了。如果不把他们尽快救到地面上来，他们就有可能丧生。然而，
事实证明营救工作非常困难。如果用炸药爆破，震动会引起矿顶塌落。因此，营救人员在矿井的北侧钻了 一
个洞。他们准备用一种特制的容器把这 6 个人救上来。如果不是因为土壤下面有一层坚硬的岩石，他们
的营救工作仅用几个小时就可以完成了。实际情况是，他们已连续钻了 16 个小时了，但离钻透还早着呢。


与此同时，两个小时以前放下井去的一只麦克风使井下的人可以与其亲属保持联系。虽然他们的食物和饮 料
都快消耗尽了，但这些人的心情很好，坚信他们很快就会出去。他们一直被告知营救工作进行得非常顺 利。

People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one. When the news got round that a comedy
show would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all rushed to see it. We had
to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.
Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen. Those who failed to get in need not have felt
disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come. The only funny things we heard that
evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme. He was obviously very nervous and for
some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone. As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out
laughing. We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually said was: 'This is the Poo and Ee
Seed Bird Company. Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!"

Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has
become more and more expensive. So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on
North Sea oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a
hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.
Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters. The fish are not sharks or killer
whales, but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as
twelve feet in length. Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil pipes
under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the total absence of fishing
boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who
eats who?

A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby. He informed the
station at once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery. The officer in the control tower was very angry
when he heard the news, because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft. He said that someone might be spying
on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object. The pilot managed to circle the balloon
for some time. He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars.
When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs. Soon afterwards, the
balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield. The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone,
for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station! As the
Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!

It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home. I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the

climbing towards the bedroom window. I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the
windows need cleaning at this time of the night.' I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a
policeman. I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'
'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man
when he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'
'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my key.'
'Your what?' he called.
'My key,' I shouted.
Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb
towards me.

One of the most famous monuments in the world, the Statue of Liberty, was presented to the United States of
America in the nineteenth century by the people of France. The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor
Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete. The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal
framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United States, a
site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York
Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was taken to
pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again and it was
officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol
of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.

【Text】
Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age. At a special
swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can
walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water. It is not long before they are so
accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular
with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven
feet under water. The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their
tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them. Some children can cover the whole length of the pool
without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time
will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping
for air.

实验证明，儿童在很小的时候就可以开始学习游泳。在洛杉矶的一个特设的游泳池里，孩子们甚至在 还

意推或是拉着三轮车。有些孩子能够跑完游泳池的全长而不用露出水面换气。他们将来是否能成 为奥林匹克
的冠军，这只能由时间来作出回答。与此同时，他们对我们中的那些游不了 5 码就已喘不过气来的人应该是

【Text】
A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the
dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after
their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead
to find their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for
the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that
are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water
when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to
the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting
away until they can be seen no more.

参考译文
日本每年过一次“亡灵节”。这个节日是个欢乐的日子，因为在这一天，据说死去的人要回到他们的家 里来，
活着的人则对他们表示欢迎。因为预料到他们在经过长途旅行之后会感到饥饿，所以为他们摆放好 了食品。
特制的灯笼挂在各家的门外，为的是帮助亡灵看清道路。整个夜晚人们载歌载舞。一大早，人们 便把为死者摆
放的食品扔进河中或海里，因为人们认为活着的人吃了这些东西是不吉利的。在靠海的城镇 中，头天夜里挂
在大街小巷的小灯笼在节后就放在了水里。成千上万只灯笼慢慢漂向大海，指引着亡灵返 回另一个世界。这
是一个感人的场面，人们成群地伫立在海岸上，注视着灯笼远去，直到再也看不见为止。
