【Text】
Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A
young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not
hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the
end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.
"It's none of your business," the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation!"
```  
```
参考译文：
上星期我去看戏. 我的座位很好, 戏很有意思, 但我却无法欣赏. 一青年男子与一青年女子坐在我的身
后, 大声地说着话. 我非常生气, 因为我听不见演员在说什么. 我回过头去怒视着那一男一女, 他们却毫不理
会. 最后, 我忍不住了, 又一次回过头去, 生气地说 : “我一个字也听不见了!”
“不关你的事, “那男的毫不客气地说, “这是私人间的谈话!”
```  
```
【课文讲解】
1 、Last week I went to the theatre.
动词 go 的原义是离开一个地方去另一个地方，与介词 to 连用后，常加上主语所要去的目的来代表主
语的动作目的。
go to the +地点 表示去某地干嘛
go to the theatre = go to the theatre to see a play 去剧场看戏
go to the cinema =see a film 去电影院看电影
go to the dairy 去牛奶店
go to the + 人 + 's 表示去这个人开的店
go to the doctor's 去看病；go to the butcher's 买肉
以下短语中名词前不加冠词：
go to school 去上学；go to church 去做礼拜；go to hospital(医院) 去看病；go to bed 上床，睡觉；
go home（跟 home 相连一定表示没有事情可做,回家休息）
I am at home. 在家休息
```
```
2 、I had a very good seat.
seat 一般指戏院、汽车等配置的固定座位，也可以抽象地表示“座位”或“位子”等概念。
the front seat of a car 汽车的前座
Take a seat, please. 请 坐 。
```
```
3 、I did not enjoy it.
enjoy vt. 欣赏，享受，喜爱
① enjoy +n. 喜欢,从当中得到一种享受（后面不能跟人）
I enjoy the music.
enjoy the dinner/film/program/game
② enjoy oneself/代词 玩的开心
We always enjoy ourselves.
③ enjoy +动名词
Jane doesn’t enjoy swimming. She enjoys going to the theatre.
```  
```
4 、I got very angry.
get 在这里有“逐渐变得”的含义，接近 become，是个表示过程的动词，表示状态的变化。而 I was very
angry 则仅表示当时的状态是生气，并不暗示过程。
I am/was angry. 是一个事实
I got angry. 强调变化过程
It is hot.
It got hot.
got 取代 be 动词，got 是一个半联系动词,可以直接加形容词。

```  
```
5 、I could not hear the actors. I turned round.
hear+人:听见某人的话
I could not hear you. Beg your pardon?
I couldn't hear you./I couldn't hear a word./I couldn't catch your words.
I couldn't hear you clearly./I couldn't catch your words.
Beg your pardon? /I couldn't catch your words.
turn round =turn around 转 身
```
```
6 、In the end, I could not bear it.
in the end 最后，终于，表示一段较长的时间之后或某种努力之后
She tried hard to finish her homework by herself. In the end, she had to ask her brother for help.
I could not bear it/you/the noise.
```
```
7 、I can't hear a word!
I can't hear a word.
美音:肯定 I can 否定,I can't, 它的/t/是吞进去的, 在读音上很难区别, 只能根据上下文来定
hear a word of sb. （a word 等于一句话）
He didn't say a word.
May I speak to Jim?/May I have a word with Jim?
```

```
8 、It's none of your business.
one’s business 指某人（所关心的或份内）的事
It's none of your business./None of your business./It's my business. 不关你的事。
It is my business to look after your health. 我必须照顾你的身体健康。
none 相当于 not any 或 no one，但语气较强。
She kept none of his letters. 他的信件她一封也没有保留。
none of 这个短语有时可以表达一种断然、甚至粗暴的口气，尤其是在祈使句中：
None of your silly remarks! 别说傻话了！
```
