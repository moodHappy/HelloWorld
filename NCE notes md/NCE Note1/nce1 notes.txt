1 ．in the North=in the north of England. 
North的首字母大写，是因为它单独使用，特指英国的北部。表示一 
个国家或地区的方位词一般要大写。本课中的方位词均表示国家的一部 
分： 
in the East 在东部 
in the West 在西方 
in the South 在南方 
但是，仅仅表示方位意义的方位词不需大写。如： 
a north wind 北风 
a south window 南窗 
2 ．Which seasons do you like best? 你最喜欢哪些季节？ 
句中的best是副词well的最高级，作状语，修饰like。 
3 ．The sun rises early and sets late. 太阳升得早而落得晚。 
句中的early和late都是副词，分别修饰动词rises和sets，作状语。 
注意the sun中定冠词的用法。在英语中，表示世界上独一无二的东西（如 
太阳、月亮、世界、地球、天空、宇宙）的名词之前通常需加定冠词。 
4 ．favourite subject of conversation, 最喜欢谈论的话题。 
英国人见面时谈话通常是从天气开始的。一方面这与英国的自然地 
理情况有关，另一方面则与英国人的民族性格有关。谈论天气是任何人 
都可接受的话题，而且这可避免介入令人尴尬的或侵入私人领域的话题。

quick----quickly 
hurried----hurriedly 
pleasant----pleasantly 
warm----warmly 
（ 2 ）以-y结尾的形容词，则把-y改成-i，再加-ly，如： 
thirsty----thirstily 
happy----happily 
（ 3 ）形容词与副词形式相同： 
late----late 
fast----fast 
hard----hard 
well----well

完全动词have（ 3 ） 
have可以代替常用动词，表示eat, enjoy, experience, drink, take等意义。 
这时的have是行为动词，所以与动作有关，而不像 have表示“具有”时 
（请参见 Lessons 59～ 60 语法部分）那样表示状态（如 I have〈got〉a car）。 
因此，它可以用于各种时态。 
如： 
Have a cigarette! 
抽根烟吧！ 
I'm having a drink. 
我在喝酒。 
We had lunch together today. 
我们今天一起吃了午饭。 
当have不表示“有”而表示其他意思时，其用法和英语中的其他动 
词相同，意即：在疑问和否定结构中，have 的一般现在时和一般过去时 
形式必须用do，does和 did： 
Do you have milk in your tea? ``` 
I don't have milk in my tea. 
``` 
 你喝茶加牛奶吗？  我喝茶不加牛奶。             ```

她说她头痛。 
He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel. 
你说他正住在一家青年招待所。 
He says he has sold his house. 
他说他已卖掉了房子。

如： 
He says: ‘I hope you are all well. ’ 
他说：“我希望你们都身体健康。”⇒ 
He says he hopes we/they are all well. 
他说他希望我们／他们都身体健康。

形容词的比较级和最高级 
（ 1 ）构成 
A 大多数单音节形容词的比较级和最高级的构成是在其原级后面加 
上-er和-est： 
small----smaller----smallest 
new----newer----newest 
B 许多单音节形容词只有一个元音字母，其末尾为一辅音字母。在 
比较级和最高级形式中，这个辅音字母要双写： 
big----bigger----biggest 
thin----thinner----thinnest 
C 许多单音节形容词以-e结尾，如 nice。这些形容词只需在原级形 
式后加-r和-st： 
large----larger----largest 
nice----nicer----nicest 
D 有些形容词以-y结尾，而在-y前是一个辅音字母。这些形容词一 
般有两个音节。变为比较级和最高级时，-y要变成-i，末尾再加-er和-est： 
easy----easier----easiest 
heavy----heavier----heaviest 
E 但有少数形容词的比较级和最高级是不规则的，必须熟记，如： 
good----better----best 
bad----worse----worst 
F 大多数较长的形容词（即有两个以上音节的词）可与more连用构 
成其比较级形式，与most连用构成其最高级形式。 
（ 2 ）用法 
比较级只用于两者之间，通常与than连用。形容词比较级之所指如 
果很清楚，它也可独立存在： 
This coat is longer. 
这件外衣较长。 
最高级用于 3 者或 3 者以上。形容词的最高级在使用时必须加定冠 
词，并常伴有一个表示范围的介词短语或从句： 
That girl is the tallest student in our class. 
那位姑娘是班上个子最高的学生。

1 ．happen to,发生在⋯⋯身上。 
What happened to you yesterday? 
你昨天出什么事了？ 
2 ．a friend of mine,我的朋友之一。 
相当于one of my friends，但前者比后者显得更为亲切。 
3 ．After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room. 他们 
进到屋里后，走进了饭厅。 
After they had entered the house 是时间状语从句，had entered 是过去完 
成时结构。在以after引导的时间状语从句中，用一般过去时或过去完成 
时没有多少差别。如果强调从句的谓语动作在主句的谓语动作之前完成， 
就用过去完成时。 
4 ．turn on, 打开，拧开（电视、水源、煤气等）。 
其反义词为 turn off（关上）。 
语法 Grammar in use 
过去完成时 
构成： had +过去分词。 
过去完成时主要用于表示两个事件中一个发生在前，或者说是表示 
较早的过去。常与现在完成时连用的副词，如 already（已经）， ever（曾 
经），for +表示时间段的词，just（刚刚）和never（从未）也常与过去完 
成时连用，以强调事件发生的先后次序。有时我们不一定非得用过去完 
成时表示先发生的事件，因为意思十分清楚，如： 
After I finished ,I went home. 
我做完后就回家了。 
请看例句： 
She went on holiday after she had taken the exam. 
她考试后度假去了。 
I ran to the platform quickly, but the train had already left. 
我赶快跑到站台上，但是火车已经开走了。

forget to do sth.表示“忘了做某事”，them指两本字典。

put和on之间。如果是代词，就必须放在put和on 之间。如：

4 ． a pleasant surprise,意想不到的好事，令人惊喜的事。

must, have to和 needn't 
这 3 个词都表示必要性。在前面已对 must和 have to介绍过。 
must是情态助动词，而have to是普通动词，二者在肯定句中一般可 
以互换，表示不可逃避的义务或责任。must 更带有说话人的主观色彩， 
而have to则更强调客观要求和外界影响。 
must一般只能表达现在的必要性，而have to则可以表达过去或将来 
的必要性。请比较： 
Must you go now? ``` 
Yes,I have to leave at once. 
``` 
``` 
Yes,I must leave at once.

我明早得离开伦敦。 
I had to stop smoking because it was forbidden in my company. 
因为我所在的公司内禁止抽烟，所以我不得不停止了吸烟。 
如果我们用 must 来提问，则只能用 needn't来表达否定的回答。 
needn't 还可以理解为have to的否定回答。needn't (don't need to)和 don't 
have to都表示不必要；而 mustn't却表示绝对禁止，在说话人看来根本没 
有选择余地。请看例句：

1 ．Where do you think you are?你认为你现在是在哪儿？ 
do you think 是用在特殊疑问句中的插入语，用来征询见解或表达看 
法。因为句中插入语已经是疑问式，主谓倒装了，所以you are的位置不 
能再对调了。插入语一般是对句子加一些附加的解释，在句子中作独立 
成分。常用来作插入语的结构有I hope, I think, I'm afraid, you know等。插 
入语可以位于句尾或句中，有时也可出现在疑问句中。 
2 ．must have been doing sth.,一定/准是在做某事。 
这种结构用来表示对过去正进行的事情的推测。下文中的can't have

过去的猜测和推断——这时可用 must have been表示肯定的推断，用 can't 
have been（而不是mustn't have been）来表示否定的推断，如后面跟进行时 
则表示对过去正在进行的动作的猜测。请看例句： 
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour. 
你当时肯定正以每小时 70 英里的速度行驶。 
I didn't see it. I must have been dreaming. 
我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。

语法 Grammar in use 
需改变时态的间接陈述句 
间接引语里常要改变时态，这是因为原来讲的话与转述这些话之间 
有一段间隔。选择哪种恰当的形式取决于转述者的着眼点。在间接引语 
里通常并不确切地重复讲话者说过的话。转述通常发生在过去，所以引 
述动词通常是过去时。因此，转述时从句的时态通常要“往回移”（back 
shift）。一条普遍的规则是：现在时变为过去时，过去时变为过去完成时。 
为过去时的情态助动词和过去完成时在转述时不变，因为不可能再往回 
移了。 
使用间接引语主要是为了简洁、紧凑地把说话内容转述给第 3 者。 
请看下面直接引语变成间接引语时在时态等方面必须作出的相应变化： 
（ 1 ）一般现在时改为一般过去时： 
‘I'm thirsty,’she said. 
“我渴了，”她说。⇒ 
She said (that) she was thirsty. 
她说她渴了。 
（ 2 ）现在进行时改为过去进行时： 
‘I'm having a rest,’ she told them. 
“我正在休息，”她告诉他们。⇒ 
She told them (that) she was having a rest. 
她告诉他们说她当时正在休息。 
（ 3 ）现在完成时改成过去完成时： 
‘I've just made a new film,’ she told me. 
“我刚完成一部新影片，”她告诉我。⇒ 
She told me(that) she had just made a new film. 
她告诉我说她刚完成一部新影片。 
（ 4 ）一般将来时改成过去将来时（一般用would +动词原形）： 
‘I'll have to ask my husband,’she said. 
“我得问问我丈夫，”她说。⇒ 
She said (that) she would have to ask her husband. 
她说她将得去问问她丈夫。 
（ 5 ）情态动词由现在时改成过去时或条件时态： 
‘I can see you tomorrow,’she said. 
“我明天可以见你，”她说。⇒ 
She said (that) she could see me the next day. 
她说她下一天可以见我。 
‘I'll help you,’she said. 
“我将帮助你的，”她说。⇒ 
She said (that) she would help me. 
她说她将帮助我。 
‘I may return at six o'clock,’ she told me. 
“我可能 6 点钟回来，”她告诉我说。⇒ 
She told me (that) she might return at six o'clock. 
 她告诉我说她可能 6 点钟回来。  （ 6 ）为过去时或条件时态的情态助动词不变： ``` 
‘I could see you tomorrow,’she said. 
“我明天可能会见你，”她说。⇒ 
She said (that) she could see me the next day. 
她说她第 2 天会见我。 
‘I would complain if I were you,’she told me. 
“如果我是你的话，我就抱怨，”她说。⇒ 
She told me (that) she would complain if she were me. 
她告诉我说，如果她是我的话她就会抱怨的。

（ 2 ）感到惊讶（或诧异）： 
She wonders at his rudeness. 
她对他的无礼感到惊讶。 
I shouldn't wonder if she is elected. 
如果她当选，我不会感到惊奇。 
2 ．sensational adj. 
（ 1 ）令人兴奋的；轰动性的： 
The discovery was sensational. 
那个发现引起了轰动。 
（ 2 ）<贬>耸人听闻的；企图追求轰动效应的： 
The sensational news report didn't have much effect on them. 
那起耸人听闻的新闻报导对他们并无多大影响。 
（ 3 ）<口>非常好；给人深刻印象的：

将来就是过去的将来，所以用过去将来时结构。

let与一般动词不同，它用于动词+宾语+动词原形结构，即let后面可

football pools 是英国流行的一种赌博方式，靠在足球比赛结果上的赌 
注来决定输赢。 
2 ．What will you do if you win a lot of money?如果你赢了许多钱，你打

才能发生，通常译为“假如”。如果条件状语从句用于询问或谈论十分

语法 Grammar in use 
第 1 类条件句 
如果我们认为将来的事件是可能发生的，就可用第 1 类条件句去描 
述将会发生什么事或不会发生什么事。其基本结构是：If +一般现在时+ 
将来时（或情态助动词），如： 
If it rains tomorrow, we won't go to the seaside. 
如果明天下雨，我们就不去海边。 
if从句中的现在时表示需具备的条件，主句中的shall/will将来时表示 
可能的结果。具备的条件是真实的，可能真的下雨。 
如果是这样，它就会有真实的结果。这就是为什么这样的陈述句常 
被称为“开放”条件句或“真实”条件句的原因。事实上，在第 1 类条 
件句中，一切现在时态都能用在if 之后，而不仅仅是一般现在时。请看 
例句： 
If he falls ,he'll hurt himself. 
如果他摔倒了，他会伤着自己的。 
If you don't hurry ,we'll miss the train. 
你要是不赶紧点儿，我们就会误了火车。

课文详注 Further notes on the text 
1 ．my four-year-old daughter，我那 4 岁的女儿。 
four-year-old 是名词 daughter的定语。各词用连字符连在一起，构成 
一个复合形容词。注意在这个复合词中仅用 year，而不用复数： 
a thirteen-year-old girl 一个 13 岁的姑娘 
2 ．⋯ Sally was invited to a children's party. ⋯⋯萨莉被邀请去参加一 
个儿童聚会。 
这是一个被动语态的例子。在英文中，如果想避免用含混不清的词 
（如 someone等）作主语，常常可使用被动词态。（具体请参见本课语 
法部分。）被动语态由相应的be动词加上过去分词构成： 
It is repaired regularly. 
它定期修理。 
They are corrected regularly. 
它们得到了定期校正。 
He was met at the station this morning. 
今早有人在车站接他。 
3 ．a middle-aged lady，一位中年女士。 
middle-aged是一个复合形容词，由名词+过去分词构成。又如： 
hand-made手工制作的 
4 ．opposite Sally，在萨莉的对面。 
这是介词短语，作状语，表示sat的具体情况。 
5 ．take out，拿出。 
6 ．make up her face，往她的脸上施脂粉。 
make up意为“化妆”、“打扮”（指擦胭脂、抹粉）。 
7 ．To make myself beautiful ⋯ 把自己打扮漂亮⋯⋯ 
这是一个省略句，句首省略了I am doing that，而只留下这个作目的 
状语的动词不定式短语。 
8 ．put away，收拾好，储存备用。 
语法 Grammar in use 
被动语态（ 1 ） 
英语动词有主动语态和被动语态之分。在主动句中，动词的主语是 
执行动作的人或物。在被动句中，主语是动作的承受者。 
在英语中被动词态用得很普遍，这样做可以避免用不明确的词作主 
语，或是将说话的重点放在事件而不是造成该事件的人或物上。 
被动语态的构成： be +过去分词。 
过去分词不一定指过去。请看例句： 
（ 1 ）一般现在时形式： am/are/is +过去分词： 
The room is aired regularly. 
这个房间定期通风。 
The knives are sharpened regularly. 
刀定期磨。 
（ 2 ）一般过去时形式： was/were +过去分词： 
She was dressed in red. 
她身穿红色衣服。 
The windows were opened this morning. 
窗户今早是开着的／被打开了。 
（ 3 ）英语中表达感情的动词通常可用于被动式，这些动词如 
amuse, embarrass, worry, surprise, interest, upset等： 
She is embarrassed. 
她感到尴尬。 
They were worried. 
他们感到担忧。
