He says: ‘I hope you are all well\. ’

他说：“我希望你们都身体健康。” 

He says he hopes we/they are all well\.

__1．happen to,发生在⋯⋯身上。__

What happened to you yesterday?

1. __After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room\. 他们__

__进到屋里后，走进了饭厅。__

After they had entered the house 是时间状语从句，had entered 是过去完成时结构。在以 after 引导的时间状语从句中，用一般过去时或过去完成时没有多少差别。如果强调从句的谓语动作在主句的谓语动作之前完成，就用过去完成时。

1. __turn on,  打开，拧开（电视、水源、煤气等）。__

其反义词为 turn off（关上）。

__语法 Grammar in use__

__过去完成时__

构成： had \+过去分词。

过去完成时主要用于表示两个事件中一个发生在前，或者说是表示较早的过去。常与现在完成时连用的副词，如 already（已经）， ever（曾经），for \+表示时间段的词，just（刚刚）和 never（从未）也常与过去完成时连用，以强调事件发生的先后次序。有时我们不一定非得用过去完成时表示先发生的事件，因为意思十分清楚，如：

After I finished ,I went home\.

我做完后就回家了。请看例句：

Put it on\.

把它穿上。

1. __That's right\.对。__

这句是对上面附加疑问句的回答。上面一句虽用否定形式提问，但回答则根据事实来决定是用肯定或是否定形式。That's right 是肯定的回答，相当于 Yes, it is（那正是我）。

这是否定疑问句，表示邀请。请参见 Lessons 77～78 语法部分。

1. __Don't you remember?你不记得了吗？__

这也是否定疑问句。

1. __don't need to= needn't。__

表示“不必”，是 must 和 have to 的一般现在时否定式。

1. __a pleasant surprise,意想不到的好事，令人惊喜的事。__

__语法院 Grammar in use must, have to 和 needn't__

这 3 个词都表示必要性。在前面已对 must 和 have to 介绍过。

must 是情态助动词，而 have to 是普通动词，二者在肯定句中一般可以互换，表示不可逃避的义务或责任。must 更带有说话人的主观色彩，而 have to 则更强调客观要求和外界影响。

must 一般只能表达现在的必要性，而 have to 则可以表达过去或将来的必要性。请比较：

Must you go now?

你必须现在就走吗？



Yes, I have to leave at once\.



是的，我不得不马上就走。

Yes, I must leave at once\.



是的，我必须马上就走。

I shall have to leave London tomorrow\.

我明早得离开伦敦。

I had to stop smoking because it was forbidden in my company\.

因为我所在的公司内禁止抽烟，所以我不得不停止了吸烟。 如果我们用 must 来提问，则只能用 needn't 来表达否定的回答。

needn't 还可以理解为 have to 的否定回答。needn't \(don't need to\)和 don't have to 都表示不必要；而 mustn't 却表示绝对禁止，在说话人看来根本没有选择余地。请看例句：

Must she leave early?

她必须早走吗？



She needn' t leave early\.



她不必早走。

Do you have to take a taxi?

__课文详注 Further notes on the text__

1. __Where do you think you are?你认为你现在是在哪儿？__

do you think 是用在特殊疑问句中的插入语，用来征询见解或表达看法。因为句中插入语已经是疑问式，主谓倒装了，所以 you are 的位置不能再对调了。插入语一般是对句子加一些附加的解释，在句子中作独立成分。常用来作插入语的结构有 I hope, I think, I'm afraid, you know 等。插入语可以位于句尾或句中，有时也可出现在疑问句中。

1. __must have been doing sth\.,一定/准是在做某事。__

这种结构用来表示对过去正进行的事情的推测。下文中的 can't have been 是 can't have been driving 的省略式，在意思上与 must have been driving正相反。

1. __That's why I didn't see the sign\.所以我才没看见那牌子。__

why I didn't see the sign 作 is 的表语从句，以 why 引导的从句用来解释事情的原因。

1. __⋯you'd better take my advice\!⋯⋯你最好还是听从我的劝告吧 ！__

take one's advice 是“听从劝告”的意思。

__语法 Grammar in use__

__表示猜测和推断的情态助动词 must 和 can't（2）__

must 与 can't 不仅能表达对现在和将来的猜测和推断，而且能表达对过去的猜测和推断——这时可用 must have been 表示肯定的推断，用 can't have been（而不是 mustn't have been）来表示否定的推断，如后面跟进行时则表示对过去正在进行的动作的猜测。请看例句：

You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour\.你当时肯定正以每小时 70 英里的速度行驶。 I didn't see it\. I must have been dreaming\.

我没看见。我当时一定是在胡思乱想吧。 She can't have been 29\.She must have been 36\. 她那时肯定不会是 29 岁，她一定 36 岁了。

He can't have been reading\. He must have been sleeping\.

他那时肯定不是在看书，他准是在睡觉。

__需改变时态的间接陈述句__

间接引语里常要改变时态，这是因为原来讲的话与转述这些话之间有一段间隔。选择哪种恰当的形式取决于转述者的着眼点。在间接引语里通常并不确切地重复讲话者说过的话。转述通常发生在过去，所以引述动词通常是过去时。因此，转述时从句的时态通常要“往回移”（ back shift）。一条普遍的规则是：现在时变为过去时，过去时变为过去完成时。为过去时的情态助动词和过去完成时在转述时不变，因为不可能再往回移了。

使用间接引语主要是为了简洁、紧凑地把说话内容转述给第 3 者。请看下面直接引语变成间接引语时在时态等方面必须作出的相应变化：

- 
	1. 一般现在时改为一般过去时： ‘I'm  thirsty,’she   said\. “我渴了，”她说。 

She said \(that\) she was thirsty\.

她说她渴了。

She told them \(that\) she was having a rest\.

她告诉他们说她当时正在休息。

- 
	1. 现在完成时改成过去完成时：

‘I've just made a new film,’ she told me\. “我刚完成一部新影片，”她告诉我。  She told me\(that\) she had just made a new film\.

她告诉我说她刚完成一部新影片。

- 
	1. 一般将来时改成过去将来时（一般用 would \+动词原形）： ‘I'll   have   to   ask   my   husband,’she   said\. “我得问问我丈夫，”她说。 

She said \(that\) she would have to ask her husband\.

她说她将得去问问她丈夫。

- 
	1. 情态动词由现在时改成过去时或条件时态： ‘I  can  see  you  tomorrow,’she  said\. “我明天可以见你，”她说。 

She said \(that\) she could see me the next day\.

她说她下一天可以见我。 ‘I'll help you,’she said\.

“我将帮助你的，”她说。 

She said \(that\) she would help me\.

她说她将帮助我。

‘I may return at six o'clock,’ she told me\. “我可能6点钟回来，”她告诉我说。  She told me \(that\) she might return at six o'clock\.

她告诉我说她可能 6 点钟回来。

- 
	1. 为过去时或条件时态的情态助动词不变： ‘I could see you tomorrow,’she said\. “我明天可能会见你，”她说。 

She said \(that\) she could see me the next day\.

她说她第 2 天会见我。

‘I would complain if I were you,’she told me\. “如果我是你的话，我就抱怨，”她说。  She told me \(that\) she would complain if she were me\.

她告诉我说，如果她是我的话她就会抱怨的。

She wonders at his rudeness\.

她对他的无礼感到惊讶。

I shouldn't wonder if she is elected\.

如果她当选，我不会感到惊奇。

1. __sensational	__adj\.
	1. 令人兴奋的；轰动性的： The discovery was sensational\.那个发现引起了轰动。
	2. <贬>耸人听闻的；企图追求轰动效应的：

The sensational news report didn't have much effect on them\.

那起耸人听闻的新闻报导对他们并无多大影响。

-

4. __⋯she would have to ask her future husband．⋯⋯她得问问她的 未婚夫。__

这部分是从句，在整句话中作 said 的直接宾语。would have to ask 是过去将来时结构。因为主句的谓语动词是 said，相对过去的这一时间点的将来就是过去的将来，所以用过去将来时结构。

1. __do the football pools,下足球赛的赌注。__

football pools 是英国流行的一种赌博方式，靠在足球比赛结果上的赌注来决定输赢。

1. __What will you do if you win a lot of money?如果你赢了许多钱， 你打算做什么呢？__

if you win a lot of money 是一个表示条件的状语从句。在英文中，条件是指某一事情（状语从句中的动作）实现之后其他事情（主句中的动作）才能发生，通常译为“假如”。如果条件状语从句用于询问或谈论十分可能发生的事情，那么条件状语从句中常用一般现在时，而主句中则用一般将来时。 a lot of 既可与可数名词也可与不可数名词连用。（请参见本课语法部分。）

__语法 Grammar in use__

__第 1 类条件句__

如果我们认为将来的事件是可能发生的，就可用第 1 类条件句去描述将会发生什么事或不会发生什么事。其基本结构是：If \+一般现在时\+将来时（或情态助动词），如：

If it rains tomorrow, we won't go to the seaside\.

如果明天下雨，我们就不去海边。

if 从句中的现在时表示需具备的条件，主句中的 shall/will 将来时表示可能的结果。具备的条件是真实的，可能真的下雨。

如果是这样，它就会有真实的结果。这就是为什么这样的陈述句常被称为“开放”条件句或“真实”条件句的原因。事实上，在第 1 类条件句中，一切现在时态都能用在 if 之后，而不仅仅是一般现在时。请看例句：

If he falls ,he'll hurt himself\.

如果他摔倒了，他会伤着自己的。

If you don't hurry ,we'll miss the train\.

你要是不赶紧点儿，我们就会误了火车。

If you feel better, you can get up\.

你要是感觉好些了的话，你就能起床了。

If I am better tomorrow, I will get up\.

如果我明天感觉好些了，我就起床下地。

If I have a headache, I will take an aspirin\.

我要是头疼的话就会服用一片阿司匹林。

1. __Tell Mary we'll be late for dinner this evening\. 你告诉玛丽，今 晚吃饭我们将晚到一会儿。__

句中 we will be late⋯是一个宾语从句，作动词 tell 的宾语。

这个宾语从句省略了引导词 that。late 表示“迟到”的意思时通常作表语，与 for 连用。

1. __by the way, 顺便（问、说一下）。__

说话者忽然想到另一件事的时候用此来表示改变话题。

__语法 Grammar in use__

__宾语从句（2）__

在以前已介绍过宾语从句一般由 that, which 和 whom 引导，它们有时在口语中可以省略。除此之外，宾语从句还可以由 when, where, what, why, how 以及 if 和 whether 这些疑问词来引导，而它们在句中往往不能加以省略。无论是 that, if 还是 wh\-疑问词引导的宾语从句通常都应以陈述句的形式出现。

请看例句：

She wants to know when you'll have a bath\.

她想知道你何时洗澡。

__课文详注 Further notes on the text__

1. __my four\-year\-old daughter，我那 4 岁的女儿。__

four\-year\-old 是名词 daughter 的定语。各词用连字符连在一起，构成一个复合形容词。注意在这个复合词中仅用 year，而不用复数：

a thirteen\-year\-old girl 一个 13 岁的姑娘

1. __⋯ Sally was invited to a children's party\. ⋯⋯萨莉被邀请去参加 一__

__个儿童聚会。__

这是一个被动语态的例子。在英文中，如果想避免用含混不清的词

（如 someone 等）作主语，常常可使用被动词态。（具体请参见本课语法部分。）被动语态由相应的 be 动词加上过去分词构成：

It is repaired regularly\.

它定期修理。

They are corrected regularly\.

它们得到了定期校正。

He was met at the station this morning\.

这是介词短语，作状语，表示 sat 的具体情况。

1. __take out，拿出。__
2. __make up her face，往她的脸上施脂粉。__

make up 意为“化妆”、“打扮”（指擦胭脂、抹粉）。

1. __To make myself beautiful ⋯ 把自己打扮漂亮⋯⋯__

这是一个省略句，句首省略了 I am doing that，而只留下这个作目的状语的动词不定式短语。

1. __put away，收拾好，储存备用。__

__语法 Grammar in use__

__被动语态（1）__

英语动词有主动语态和被动语态之分。在主动句中，动词的主语是执行动作的人或物。在被动句中，主语是动作的承受者。

在英语中被动词态用得很普遍，这样做可以避免用不明确的词作主语，或是将说话的重点放在事件而不是造成该事件的人或物上。

被动语态的构成： be \+过去分词。过去分词不一定指过去。请看例句：

- 
	1. 一般现在时形式： am/are/is \+过去分词：

The room is aired regularly\.

这个房间定期通风。

The knives are sharpened regularly\.

刀定期磨。

	1. 英语中表达感情的动词通常可用于被动式，这些动词如

amuse, embarrass, worry, surprise, interest, upset 等：

She is embarrassed\.她感到尴尬。 They were worried\.他们感到担忧。

__词汇学习		Word study 1．embarrassed	__adj\.
