__课文详注 Further notes on the text__

1. __Where do you come from? 你是哪国人？__

问对方是什么地方人。come from 表示来源或籍贯。也可说：Where are you from? 在第 7 课中出现过类似的句子。

1. __What's the climate like in your country? 你们国家的气候怎么样？__

句中 like 是介词，不是动词，它的宾语是 What。又如：What's the weather like in spring? climate 指某一地区数年间的天气情况；weather 是指某个特定的时间内晴、雨、风、雪变化。对于这类问题的回答可以是 It's very pleasant（很好）或 It rains sometimes（有时下雨）。这里的 it 均指天气。

1. __It's often windy in March\. 3 月里常常刮风。__

表示在某个月份里通常用介词in。类似用in的时间短语课文中还有 in April（在 4 月），in June（在 6 月），in September（在 9 月）等等。

often（经常），always（总是，老是），sometimes（有时）都是课文中出现的表示非确定频度的副词。这些副词一般用来回答用 how often 提问的问题。

__语法 Grammar in use What⋯\(be\. look, etc\.\) like?__

我们把 What⋯like? 这一句型用于询问事物的状况，例如天气、气候等：

What's the weather like today?

今天天气怎么样？ What's it like today?今天怎么样？

What's the climate like in your country?

你们国家气候怎么样？

或询问人物或事物的外观或特征：

What's your brother like?你兄弟是个什么样子？ What's your house like? 你的房子是什么样的？

许多形容词可用以回答 What⋯like? 这样的问题，并可根据上下文给

以笼统的或确切的信息。例如课文中表示天气或气候的形容词有 pleasant

（宜人的），windy（有风的），hot（热的），cold（冷的），warm（温暖的）等等。

__词汇学习		Word study 1．sometimes	__adv\.

有时，间或：

1. __in the North=in the north of England\.__

North 的首字母大写，是因为它单独使用，特指英国的北部。表示一个国家或地区的方位词一般要大写。本课中的方位词均表示国家的一部分：

但是，仅仅表示方位意义的方位词不需大写。如：

a north wind 北风

句中的 early 和 late 都是副词，分别修饰动词 rises 和 sets，作状语。注意 the sun 中定冠词的用法。在英语中，表示世界上独一无二的东西（如太阳、月亮、世界、地球、天空、宇宙）的名词之前通常需加定冠词。

1. __favourite subject of conversation, 最喜欢谈论的话题。__

英国人见面时谈话通常是从天气开始的。一方面这与英国的自然地理情况有关，另一方面则与英国人的民族性格有关。谈论天气是任何人都可接受的话题，而且这可避免介入令人尴尬的或侵入私人领域的话题。

__语法 Grammar in use like __\(v\.\)__与 like __\(prep\.\)

由 every, this, next 等词开头的时间状语前面通常不加介词。

1. __I'm going to meet some friends, Dad\. 我打算去看几个朋友，爸爸 。__

dad 和 mum 前如没有所有格代词或名词所有格作修饰语，就特指自己的父母亲，要大写。father 和 mather 也是如此。

1. __Jill's eighteen years old, Tom\. 吉尔都 18 岁了，汤姆。__

表示“几岁”，一般由基数词\+ year\(s\) old 构成。在口语中，year\(s\)old往往可以省去，而只用数字表示年龄。如：

She is eighteen\.

她 18 岁。

1. __That's all right\. 不用谢。__

以上两种情况也可以用直接读出钟点和分钟的方式来表达：

eight twenty 8 点 20 分

six forty\-seven	6 点 47 分

表示在什么时间通常都需用介词 at：

副词（adverb）这个词的本意是补充动词的意义。这就是许多副词的作用。它们可以通过修饰动词告诉我们有关句中某个动作的情况，也就是告诉我们某事是如何、何时、何地等发生或进行的。

副词可以是单个的词（如 slowly）或词组（如 very well）。单一副词既有以\-ly 结尾的也有不以\-ly 结尾的（如 quickly, fast）。

形容词向副词的转换一般遵循 3 个规则：

- 
	1. 在形容词后面直接加\-ly，如：

quick	quickly

hurried	hurriedly

pleasant	pleasantly

warm	warmly

- 
	1. 以\-y 结尾的形容词，则把\-y 改成\-i，再加\-ly，如：

thirsty	thirstily

happy	happily

- 
	1. 形容词与副词形式相同：

late	late

fast	fast

hard	hard

well	well

go	went see		saw

understand	understood

take	took

read\-\-\-\-read ／red／

drink	drank

run	ran

know	knew

put	put

cut	cut

eat	ate

meet	met

come	came

lose	lost

__1．I want to see the dentist, please\. 我想见牙科医生。__

I want to see sb\., please 这一句式是表示想见某人时常用的句式之一。

1. __have an appointment\(with sb\.\)，（与某人）有约会。__

I have an appointment with my dentist at 3 p\.m\.

我已约定下午 3 点去看牙医。

1. __Is it urgent? 急吗？__

这里的 it 指“要见牙医”这件事。

1. __Can you come at 10 a\. m\. on Monday, April 24th?您在 4 月 24 日星期__

__一上午 10 点钟来可以吗？__

Can you come at⋯? 这一句式通常用来约定见面时间。注意英语中的时间次序一般是由小到大，与汉语正好相反。又如：on July 2nd, 1988

（在 1988 年 7 月 2 日）, at seven on June 3rd, 1989 （在 1989 年 6 月 3日 7 点）。 a\. m\. \(=ante meridiem\) 上午，有时写成 A\. M\. 或 AM；下午则是 p\. m\. \(=post meridiem\)，有时写成 P\. M\. 或 PM。

__5．I must see⋯我必须见⋯⋯__

比 I want to see⋯ 语气上要更强些，表达说话人某种强烈的愿望或需求。

1. __at the moment, 正在说话的这会儿，此时。__
2. __Can't you wait till this afternoon? 您就不能等到今天下午了吗？__

这是情态助动词的否定疑问句形式，表示请求。

__语法 Grammar in use__

__否定疑问句__

否定疑问句可以表示说话者惊异的情绪、责难的口吻或赞叹；也可表示说话者的某种建议、邀请、请求或看法等。请看下列疑问句的简略否定式：

\(be:\) Aren't you a student? 难道你不是学生吗？ Isn't it hot here?

这里难道不热吗？

\(can:\) Can't you wait a moment?

你不能等一会儿吗？ \(have:\) Haven't I asked you?难道我没问过你吗？

\(do:\) Don't you want to stay with us?

你难道不愿意与我们呆在一起吗？

\(did:\) Didn't you see him yesterday?

难道你昨天没看见他吗？

回答这种问题时用简略回答。如果答语是肯定的，就用 Yes；如果答语是否定的，就用 No。不过，这种答语的汉语译法有特殊之处。如：

Don' t you know English?

你不懂英语吧？



Yes, I do\.



不，我懂。

一般否定疑问句有完全式和简略式之分，它们的词序是不同的。完全式：

Is she not a nurse?

她不是一位护士吗？简略式：

Isn't she a nurse?

她不是一位护士吗？

__完全动词 have（3）__

have 可以代替常用动词，表示 eat, enjoy, experience, drink, take 等意义。这时的 have 是行为动词，所以与动作有关，而不像 have 表示“具有”时

如：

Have a cigarette\!

抽根烟吧！

I'm having a drink\.

我在喝酒。

We had lunch together today\.

我们今天一起吃了午饭。

当 have 不表示“有”而表示其他意思时，其用法和英语中的其他动词相同，意即：在疑问和否定结构中，have 的一般现在时和一般过去时形式必须用 do，does 和 did：

Do you have milk in your tea?

__一般将来时__

- 
	1. 一般将来时表示将来某一时刻的动作、状态以及打算。该时态一般与表示将来意义的时间状语连用，如 tomorrow（明天），this month

（本月）， the day after tomorrow（后天），next week （下周）， in two days' time（两天之后）， from now on（从现在起），in the future（将来）等。

- 
	1. 一般将来时的形式为 will／shall\+ 动词原形。

will 可用于所有人称，但 shall 仅表示单纯将来时用于第一人称 I 和

we，作为 will 的一种替代形式。

否定缩写： shan't =shall not, won't =will not:

I shan't leave tonight\. I'll leave tomorrow\.今天夜里我不走。我将于明天离开。 They won't go to London this weekend\. 这个周末他们不去伦敦。

此外，will 除了表示纯粹的将来时间外，还表示说话人的意图和意愿，

而 shall 除了表示将来时间外同时还表示说话人的责任或决心。

- 
	1. 除了 will/shall 外，还可以用其他方法表示将来。在口语中，be going to 比 will/shall 更为普通，用来表示说话人的意图或打算。如：

She is going to travel by air\.

她打算乘飞机旅行。

也可用来表示有迹象某事即将发生。如：

It's going to rain\.

将要下雨了。

- 
	1. 	可与将来时连用的时间短语有：今天：

this morning/afternoon/evening 今天上午／下午／晚上 tonight 今夜明天：

tomorrow morning/ afternoon/evening 明天上午／下午／晚上后天：

the day after tomorrow 后天 the night after next 后天夜里其他：

in the morning 在上午 in the afternoon 在下午 in the evening 在晚上
